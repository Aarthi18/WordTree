abstractBackground Teacher turnover is a major issue for early childhood organizations and it is critical to understand reasons for leaving their current teaching position at the organizational level to create more stable early care and education environmentsObjective The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the item Early Childhood Job Attitude Survey ECJAS and to determine which organizationallevel factors predict teachers actual turnoverMethod Data fromearly childhood early head start and head start teachers were collected at two time points in the United States Internal consistencies and the factor structure of the ECJAS scale were testedResults Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggested that items load onto the ECJAS and it revealed three subscales workplace satisfaction classroom responsibilities and ongoing support The internal consistency and the construct validity across three factors were adequate Examining the associations between early childhood teachers job attitudes measured by the ECJAS and their actual turnover we conducted the multilevel analysis and found that teacher perceived workplace satisfaction predicted their turnover after controlling for teachers age race marital status educational attainment program types and employment positionConclusion Early childhood organizations are encouraged to use these findings to make organizational changes and to retain their teachersSchools remain among the most frequent providers of childrens mental health services particularly in lowincome urban settings Several decades of research have focused on training teachers to implement evidencebased interventions for minimizing disruptive behavior Studies consistently demonstrate robust improvements in student behavior and learning however the impact on teachers workrelated stress or satisfaction is not well understood Six urban highpoverty elementary schools were randomly assigned to a school mental health services model Links to Learning LL for referred disruptive students or to services and professional development as usual SAU Teachers n K general education teachers in LL schools participated in professional development and consultation in two universal and two targeted interventions to reduce disruptive behaviors and promote learning Teachers n in SAU schools participated in professional development as usual Multiple regression models examined teacher reports of individuallevel selfefficacy classroomlevel student functioning and schoollevel organizational health as predictors of stress and satisfaction Findings revealed no significant difference between conditions on teacher workrelated stress or satisfaction Organizational health was the strongest predictor of stress and satisfaction Training on and implementation of evidencebased classroom interventions did not appear to significantly impact teachers workrelated stress or satisfaction Instead findings point to organizational climate and teacher connectedness as potential levers for change supporting prior work on teacher stress and satisfaction in schools The significance of targeting organizational factors may be particularly significant in urban school districtsOver the last few years the effect that teachers beliefs have on the results achieved by their students has been widely

from country to country Taking into account the multistructural level of available data teachers Levelare nested within schools Levelin each country data analysis has been carried out by means of multilevel structural equation modeling More specifically a multigroup multilevel model has been designed to study the effect of teachers traits Levelpredictors and school traits Levelpredictors on the perceived level of selfefficacy in different countries The results show that variables relating to the teachers as professionals cooperation with their colleagues encouraging selfevaluation by the students teachers perception of satisfactory class discipline a need for professional development in the contents of the subject taught and in teaching skills and having a constructivist teaching approach are the ones most closely related to their selfefficacy beliefs These are more important than factors associated with the institutional setting in which they work ownership ratio or shortage of resources or strictly personal traits age gender or work situationThis study examined the relationship between school leaders instructional leadership and teachers functional competency in high

article I use narrative inquiry and critical race theory CRT to examine the stories of two elementary school principals struggling to create more inclusive schools for Black boys with emotional disabilities ED in a racially segregated and lowperforming district Each principal narrative describes efforts to transition a student with ED from a districtcreated selfcontained program to a fulltime or nearfulltime placement in an inclusive general education classroom Despite the principals overall success in creating more inclusive schools for most students with disabilities in a challenging district context each principal narrative ends with a student being unsuccessful in an inclusive setting and returned to a segregated program The findings highlight how principals who recognize the vulnerability of Black boys in special education are compelled to create more inclusive schools but can confront significant institutional organizational and social and emotional challenges Applying CRT to these cases provides additional insights into how principals can develop inclusive schools and challenge segregated programs While some inclusive leadership practices aimed at improving the educational outcomes of Black boys are identified throughout these narratives the significance of the study lies in documenting and understanding how principals experience the barriers and challenges to creating more socially just and inclusive schoolsTeacher satisfaction is a key affective reaction to working conditions and an important predictor of teacher attrition

explore teachers SE in contrast with their actual teaching skills and their characteristics For this reason this study aims to respond to the following research questions are there differences between perceived SE and actual teaching performance in preschool and primary school teachers Which sources of SE can be considered as significant predictors of teachers SE This work employs a quantitative approach based on the observational method Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale and classroom observation frameworks were used to collect data from a sample ofteachers Results show that there are high inconsistencies between selfjudgments and actual teaching performance p Experienced and medium experienced teachers show higher scores than novice teachers in several dimensions of SE p However teachers educational background is not significantly correlated with their SE p Resource support is found as the only significant predictor of SE in our sample of teachers p p Our research suggests that teachers may have a distorted perception of their inclass performance which could drive to lower quality of the teachinglearning process Therefore in the future professional training programs should focus on promoting a more realistic understanding and awareness of teachers actions in the classroom as the first step of any intervention aiming to increase teaching qualityPublically funded charter schools are becoming a feasible option for parents and students in the US during the past years Research shows that charter schools tend to operate under similar characteristics and systems

factors determining educational achievement However the lack of instruments to measure it has complicated the study of this concept in Russia We review the history of the study of the concept of school climate and we discuss approaches to how it can be defined We describe the most widely used questionnaires for studying school climate and analyze the set of components that have been included in them To conduct the empirical study we chose the student questionnaire that is used in the PISA international study which provides a theoretical basis for measuring a number of dimensions of school climate We conducted a psychometric analysis using methods from confirmatory factor analysis and modern test theory It turned out that the structure of the indices that are used to measure school climate is not what the framers of the questionnaire assumed it would be It is unclear whether the questions reflect the school climate indicators that are specifically proposed in the questionnaires Some of the judgments in the questionnaire have been worded in such a way as to elicit most students agreement or disagreement with them without revealing any differences in how students perceive the subject of the question The answer categories are unbalanced for most of the judgments Respondents tended to fill them out in a onesided fashion We propose steps for how the instrument can be further improvedThe Mindfulness in Teaching Scale MTS is a selfreport measure of teacher mindfulness The purpose of the present study was to explore the factor structure and the psychometric properties of

Korean teachers n age range years Second confirmatory factor analysis with a second sample of Korean teachers n age range years showed that the twofactor structure is appropriate and each subfactor revealed a good internal consistency Third both subscales of the MTSK correlated positively with dispositional mindfulness teacher efficacy and job satisfaction and negatively with job stress and teacher burnout The data suggest that MTS and MTSK have a similar conceptual organization regarding teacher mindfulness in the school context PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe

steadily over the last thirty years This study explored this situation in the hope of identifying strategies to decrease attrition and promote retention It reviewed the relationship of three variables grit job satisfaction and cultural competence to teacher length of service in an urban school district Differences in scores on the three independent variables were examined between regular and special education teachers within the sample Additionally the study investigated whether the statistically significant variables could produce a model for predicting teacher length of service The sample includedregular and special education teachers from one mediumsized urban K school district in southeastern Pennsylvania The research was grounded in resilience theory where predictors were studied for their ability to be considered mechanisms that could alter the risk impact of teacher attrition in urban schools The results of the research indicated that job satisfaction and cultural competence have a statistical relationship v with teacher length of service in the district studied Special education teachers demonstrated a statistically significant higher job satisfaction rate than the regular education teachers within the sample Implications for educators based on the results of this study include improving training for school leaders on the importance of job satisfaction and Personal Involvement of staff within the school community The role of professional development for preservice teachers current teachers and school leaders on unique aspects of the urban education setting have also emerged PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedTeacher attrition continues to impact public schools that seek to retain teachers in the classroom and meet rising enrollment rates The recruitment of experienced career changing professionals into the educational workforce is a viable option to address teacher shortages In addition while the use of mentorship may support teacher retention and job satisfaction for novice teachers inconsistencies in mentoring practices have limited the effectiveness of mentoring programs and support systems The problem of limited research that examines the needs of career changing teachers CCTs and their initial mentoring experiences was addressed in this study The social learning theory and Maslows hierarchy of needs frameworks were used in this phenomenological study to explore perceptions ofnovice CCTs from the middle or high school levels who had completedtoyears of teaching service The research questions focused on CCTs perceptions of their mentoring experience and the support they needed as novice teachers Data collected fromrounds of semistructured interviews were analyzed with a multilevel coding approach to identify patterns and emergent themes Emergent themes revealed CCTs experiences and skills as viable teaching candidates perceptions of their mentoring experiences and support and retention needs The findings revealed CCTs desire for support in mentorship availability and quality improvement in instructional pedagogy and the promotion of emotional resiliency and job satisfaction Recommendations point to the need for mentorship as ongoing practice the personalization of mentorship programs and the leveraging of professional development practices to provide mentoring support The major implications for social change are the improvement of mentoring program design and the implementation for the development and retention of highly effective teachers to

basic interpretative study exploredchildcare teachers perceptions of job satisfaction and how their motivation has had an instrumental impact on theiryears or more of job sustainability In examining the childcare teachers perceptions of job satisfaction the primary research question guiding this study was What are the motivational factors that childcare teachers perceive to have contributed to their job satisfaction and retention The theoretical framework underlying this study was the SelfDetermination Theory a theory that describes how interactions between early childhood teachers and the system within their work influences motivation in their teaching and their authentic wellbeing as an educator DeciRyanThe research participants were childcare teachers with a CDA Child Development Associate and hadyears or more of childcare teaching experience as a childcare teacher Semistructured interviews provided a rich thick description of the experiences of the participants The basic interpretative study took place in the natural world of the childcare profession with the focus on the context of job satisfaction RossmanRallisThe constant comparison analysis indicated four major themes motivation of being a childcare teacher a community of collegiality a definition of job satisfaction and inspiration of becoming a childcare teacher Evidence also emerged that the participants would recommend the early childhood profession to other potential childcare teachers because of their job satisfaction despite their low wages and lack of recognition for their work Based on the motivational factors of the childcare teachers perceptions of job satisfaction a model was initiated with the purpose to improve recruitment and retention of childcare teachers Collegiality is the basis and the foundation of the model which is paramount for a functional and supportive community of collegiality DuFour DuFour EakerKarhanekThe motivational factors of the model are organizational climate professional development intrinsic motivation and credentials In addition the Model of Motivational Factors could increase student achievement with less childcare teacher turnover Future research should focus on what the childcare teachers perceive as obstacles in the early childhood profession and what they would recommend to recruit and retain childcare teachers Their recommendations could merge and connect with this studys motivational factors Their recommendations for recruitment and retention of childcare teachers would be their voice on a personal level which could be the basis for the study PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedTransformational leaders increase job satisfaction and wellbeing among workers This thesis proposes that leadership style is influenced by both the rational and experiential systems put forward by Epstein b in his cognitiveexperiential self theory CEST Study one examined the relationship between the CEST informationprocessing systems and transformational leadership among experienced school leaders N The rational system had a strong positive correlation with transformational leadership whereas the experiential system was weakly correlated with transformational leadership Study two N examined constructive thinking and transformational leadership Global constructive thinking emotional coping and behavioural coping all had strong positive correlations with transformational leadership The results of studies one and two showed that school principals who rated themselves as transformational leaders obtained high scores on the rational system and the constructive factors of the experiential system These results provided a theoretical foundation for the remaining three studies and impacted on the theoretical framework for the CESTtransformational leadership model Studies one and two were correlational in design and consequently were limited in explaining cause and effect In response to this limitation study three used a pretest posttest controlgroup design to test whether changes to informationprocessing systems could bring about changes in leadership style Results showed that there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest transformational leadership scores for school principals in the intervention group as rated by their school staff The control group remained unchanged Qualitative results indicated that the school principals in the intervention group became more conscious and reflective about their leadership practice Thus study three provided tentative evidence that changing informationprocessing styles could bring about changes in leadership style With the results showing a positive connection between informationprocessing and transformational leadership Studies onethree the next step was to establish if the rational system and constructive elements of the experiential level could predict teachers job satisfaction and student learning outcomes Study four N showed a weak connection between principals informationprocessing and both teachers job satisfaction and students learning outcomes Leaders who exercise transformational leadership may also be required to effectively manage conflict in the organization and this is why study five N examined the relationship between informationprocessing and conflicthandling styles using an undergraduate student sample The rational system experiential system and constructive thinking had significant positive relationships with both the integrating and compromising conflicthandling styles The rational system had a positive relationship with the dominating conflicthandling style The experiential system and constructive thinking had a positive relationship with the obliging conflicthandling style The results of the five studies provided empirical support for a CESTtransformational leadership model Implications for educational leadership at the theoretical and practical level are discussed Establishing a positive connection between informationprocessing transformational leadership and the choice of conflicthandling styles appears to promote effective school leadership that in turn is thought to influence teachers job satisfaction and students learning outcomes PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThis quantitative study investigated factors that influence the job satisfaction of teachers at a large K Christian school Selected demographic variables gender marital status grade level taught and years of teaching

schools The following subquestions were designed to answer that overarching question What are perceived reasons that teachers choose to teach in Christian schools What could Christian schools do that would increase their teachers job satisfaction Do these vary by gender years of teaching experience marital status or whether the teacher teaches in elementary middle or high school This study was conducted during the Spring semester of theschool year The participants were asked to complete the Teacher Job Satisfaction Questionnaire TJSQ The research instrument was distributed at a mandatory faculty meeting The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to calculate measures of central tendency mean and measures of variation standard deviation Once the mean and standard deviation for each level were found Cohens d using pooled variances was used to calculate an effect size difference for each level The research reflects that there were small variances in teacher job satisfaction perceptions in relation to the gender of the teachers with male teachers perceiving slightly higher levels of job satisfaction There was also a small variance in teacher perceptions of job satisfaction in relation to the teachers marital status with married teachers reporting slightly higher levels of satisfaction The size difference for both the gender and marital status of the teachers responses was indicated by a Cohens d effect size ofThe grade level taught revealed a moderate variance of job satisfaction perceptions High school teachers were the most satisfied with their jobs and middle school teachers were the least satisfied in their teaching positions In this study the years of teaching experience indicate that job satisfaction perceptions change as the years of

for agricultural education teachers in North Carolina Lack of compensation salary increases and public criticism of teachers have created a unique situation that warrants the investigation of the current levels of job satisfaction of North Carolina agricultural teachers Job satisfaction levels have been used as a predictor of an individuals decision to leave or end employment The purpose of this study was to determine the overall levels of job satisfaction of teachers to compare intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction levels and to investigate relationship or differences between factors related to job satisfaction This study used a descriptive research design The instrument was developed by combining the Minnesota Satisfaction QuestionnaireMSQ short form with demographic variables to help determine the relationship between these variables and the level of job satisfaction of the respondents The agriculture teachers in this study reported a very high level of overall job satisfaction The teachers also reported a very high level of intrinsic job satisfaction and a high level of extrinsic job satisfaction Though the extrinsic level of job satisfaction is high there is room for improvement by providing praise for fellow teachers recognizing accomplishments through award and recognition programs and providing coping mechanisms as a part of professional development programs to address areas of lower satisfaction There were no reported significant relationships between salary age experience in years of teaching highest educational level completed or the number of

focus on teachers selfefficacy beliefs perceptions of inquiry learning and satisfaction with the training course Teachers selfefficacy and their perceptions of inquiry learning were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the training course Satisfaction with the training course was measured only at the end of the training The study identified three distinct selfefficacy profiles among the participants Low moderate and high The selfefficacy of teachers belonging to the high and the moderate group remained unchanged throughout the training while the selfefficacy for student engagement improved in the lowefficacy group At the beginning of the training course differences were found between the low and high selfefficacy profiles in terms of teachers perceptions of resources for inquiry learning and their anxiety toward inquiry learning however only the former difference remained based on the posttest results Interestingly although there were three clear selfefficacy profiles and these groups also differed in terms of prior experiences with inquiry learning all teacher groups were both satisfied in general with the training course and with the utility value of the

the quality of teacher learning across different contexts The available instruments however have been originally developed to assess teachers perceptions of a single contributive element of teacher learning therefore multiple interacting variables which influence the complex process of teacher professional development in English Language Teaching ELT contexts have received little attention This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument whose items are particular to ELT teachers and contexts To this end based on a detailed study of the related literature interviews with ELT practitioners and teacher education professionals a preliminary theoretical model was proposed The model was verified and developed into an English Language Teacher Learning Scale After developing the scale and administering it toELT teachers it was validated through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses which resulted in a few alterations This study portrays a more inclusive picture of teacher learning in ELT contexts in terms of factors related to teacher cognition and belief teacher emotions teacher motivation and contextual variablesKindergarten through thgrade classrooms is

this issue are presented in the paper The first approach assumes that the personality plays a determining role and that ones profession is selected according to the characteristic features of ones personality The second approach asserts that profession has a significant influence on personality and determines the development of the qualities necessary for the profession The basic concepts of professional development and professional selfdevelopment are discussed The professional development of teachers is associated with the formation of motives for professional activity and professional abilities and competences The professional development of teachers is closely connected with their personal development It leads to the selfmovement toward the needs motives goals and tasks of teachers The dynamics of this process depend on the teachers activity initiative responsibility selfregulation and selfdetermination The professional development of teachers is not only a process but also the result of increasing hisher selforganisation selfassertion and selfrealisation in the social cultural and professional environment The authors conclude professional development continues throughout the professional life of a teacher which starts at moment of professional selfdeterminationThe document analysis method was conducted to discuss about the OECD TALIS findings inrelated to

satisfaction among teachers We distinguish among charter schools managed by forprofit education management organizations EMOs and nonprofit charter management organizations CMOs and standalone charter schools We investigate our research question using data from the School and Staffing Survey We find that teachers in charter schools are less satisfied with their jobs than teachers in traditional public schools We also find that teachers in EMOmanaged schools appear less satisfied than those in standalone charter schools Our analyses suggest that lower salaries and limited union memberships help drive these lower levels of satisfaction particularly among standalone charter schools and charter schools managed by EMOsGreen construction is gaining foothold among professionals decision makers and the broader public However its success depends on a clear minded analysis of its pros and cons based on critical assessment including costbenefit analysis This paper makes a first attempt at such an analysis of some of the first green sustainable schools in Israel It deals with a limited sample available as well as diverse rating systems which the different architects have chosen to comply with By identifying and isolating the green premium of those schools which are comparable and by analyzing actual direct benefits for the schools through energy and water billsandlower consumption respectively per year the paper concludes that for the time being the payback period of green schools in Israel may prove counterproductive and prohibitive if calculated only on the basis of these two direct and immediate benefits However including in the analysis additional benefits eg staff satisfaction included in this paper student achievements user and broader public health issues and other public benefits not included in this paper can change the costbenefit analysis outcome significantlyPurpose Given the inconsistency among research studies on the relationship between burnout and job satisfaction of teachers in Turkey it is of great importance to combine and interpret the results of such studies In this regard this study aims to examine the size and direction of relationships between job satisfaction and dimensions of burnout and to determine the possible effect of moderator variables on these relationships Research Method The study was designed using a metaanalysis method Identified as appropriate to the specified inclusion criteriastudies for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization andfor reduced personal accomplishment were included in this metaanalysis The total sample size of the included studies wasfor emotional exhaustion and depersonalization andfor reduced personal accomplishment In the study the possibility of a publication bias was examined The included studies were determined to be heterogeneous A randomeffects model was used in the computation of effect sizes Findings In the study the relationships between job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion and between job satisfaction and reduced personal accomplishment were found to be negative and at a medium level whereas between job satisfaction and depersonalization the relationship was found to be negative and at a low level For studytype and gradelevel moderators the variance among studies did not statistically differ Implications for Research and Practice Teachers higher emotional exhaustion depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment relatively reduce their job satisfaction Further research might be beneficial in favor of extending the generalization in specific cultures and in combining inconsistent research results existing in literaturePurpose The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a piece of research concerning the practice of Cypriot school principals instructional role and its effect on teachers job satisfaction and also to investigate whether higher levels of teachers job satisfaction can be predicted when school principals deal with and accomplish their instructional tasks Designmethodologyapproach Quantitative methods were used two questionnaires together with qualitative methods observation interviews informal conversations and collection of artifacts Findings The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that higher levels of teachers job satisfaction are not predicted when principals deal with and accomplish their instructional tasks This result is rather unexpected considering the trends of modern bibliography regarding the value and effects on teachers of principals instructional and transformational leadership The triangulation of the results helped the authors to reexamine the research question and creates a deeper understanding of the practice of principals instructional role and the sources of teachers job satisfaction Practical implications The results are analyzed and discussed in order to reach conclusions about the evaluation selection and training of school principals Through the description of the instructional practice of school principals useful information concerning teachers job satisfaction are also provided Finally the conclusions of this research may prove useful for educational policy makers since they can guide them on the successful implementation of changes Changes are needed in the evaluation and promotion system of Cyprus and in the content of principals training programs School principals must be taught different leadership styles eg transformational and transactional leadership and learn to modify their leadership behavior according to the situation and the professional maturity of their teachers In this way they will be able to increase the level of teachers satisfaction as to become more effective in their teaching Originalityvalue At a time when instructionaltransformational leadership is presented to be a panacea for many educational issues including raising teachers job satisfaction this research with its mixed methodology highlights the complexity and the various interpretations of these concepts and also provides explanations on why many principals do not act as instructional leadersPurpose The purpose of this paper is to replicate prior findings on teacherprincipal race congruence and teacher job satisfaction and extend the literature by investigating trends over time and if the relationship between race congruence and teacher job satisfaction differs by principal race and regionDesignmethodologyapproach The study sample comes from four waves of crosssectional data the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey administered betweenandThe analysis is conducted using ordinary least squares and schoolyear fixed effects with a comprehensive set of covariatesFindings The relationship between race congruence and teacher job satisfaction is attenuating over time and is likely explained by the lower job satisfaction of white teachers who work for black principals Some evidence indicates teacherprincipal race congruence has greater salience in the Southern region of the country Find evidence that teachers with racecongruent principals report more workplace support than their nonrace congruent colleaguesResearch limitationsimplications Future studies should investigate why racial congruence has more salience in the Southern region of the country and for white teachers who work with black principals At the same time results indicate that teacherprincipal race congruence might no longer be a determinant of teacher job satisfaction although further studies should continue investigating this relationshipOriginalityvalue Findings on the changing nature of the relationship between principalteacher race congruence and teacher job satisfaction over time as well as the differing nature of race congruence in the Southern region of the country are both novel findings in the literaturePurpose As a result of continuous reforms increased emphasis has been placed on participative leadership as a means to improving school and teacher outcomes However along with the benefits of participative leadership comes the potential for strain and burnout which stem from work intensification Applying the implicit leadership theory and the conservation of resources theory the purpose of this paper is to propose that differences in schools cultural attributes will influence the emergence of participative leaders and their influence on teachers outcomes of job satisfaction and burnoutDesignmethodologyapproach Data were collected by survey from a sample ofteachers in IsraelFindings First the results of general linear model GLM analysis indicated significant differences in the teachers perceptions of participative leadership between schools characterized by different cultural attributes Second the results of GLM indicated significant differences in the effects of participative leadership on teacher burnout across schools characterized by different cultural attributesOriginalityvalue This study has implications for policies involving the design and implementation of leadership tools for school management Although research has emphasized the relationship between stressful job conditions associated with shared decision making and teachers wellbeing and job satisfaction the volume of comparative work in the educational field shedding light on the impact of schools cultural attributes on this question is limited This study may assist principals in making their schools both more effective and more responsive to teacher expectationsIntroduction The suitability of the salaries and benefits of faculty members for their livelihoods is one of the most important factors in their job satisfaction Therefore this research was conducted to determine how the salaries and benefits of faculty members are calculated in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran Methods This descriptive and analytical study was conducted to shed more light on the way the salaries and benefits of faculty members employed at the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran are calculated Research data were collected through searching published articles in Iranian and international reputable websites as well as the administrative and employment regulations of faculty members of universities and higher education institutions affiliated to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran and further amendments and directives in this regard Results The salaries of the faculty members in Iran are determined on the basis of the salary coefficient announced annually by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran In addition their salaries will increase with regard to the type of service the increase of the base level promotion lack of specific profit activities outside university acquisition of managerial positions marriage and having children for men Conclusion Faculty members expect their salaries to be calculated and paid equitably and to increase each year in proportion to the inflation rate so that they do not have to carry out unrelated and nonacademic activities outside the university in order to solve their livelihood problemsInMcLaughlin BlackHawkins and McIntyre published a literature review that explored the ways in which individual teachers whole schools and groups of networked schools were engaging in practitioner research and enquiry In the light of significant changes to the education landscape the empirical research in this article provides an account of engagement withschool leaders to explore what schools are doing in the area of practitioner research or enquiry today Although teachers in schools may both use research and generate findings this research was particularly concerned with the generation of professional knowledge through research and enquiry in schools in England today A sample of school leaders was interviewed to establish their current approach Findings include questions about the effects on teachers dissatisfaction in the face of a revealed gap between actuality and idealism the possible evolution of a new teachereducator population and the effects on those working in higher education as they address the shifting needs of twentyfirstcentury teacher education As schoolbased research continues to be a factor this represents a timely scoping of the thinking of school senior leaders and considers the implications of this developing practiceThe Classroom Appraisal of Resources and Demands CARD was designed to evaluate teacher stress based on subjective evaluations of classroom demands and resources However the CARD has been mostly utilized in western countries The aim of the current study was to provide aspects of the validity of responses to a Chinese version of the CARD that considers Chinese teachers unique vocational conditions in the classroom A sample ofChinese elementary school teachersfemale teachers andmale teachers were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the CARD Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the data fit the theoretical model very well eg CFINFIGFISRMRRMSEAwhere CFI is comparative fit index NFI is normed fit index GFI is goodness of fit SRMR is standardized root mean square residual RMSEA is root mean square error of approximation thus providing evidence of construct validity Latent constructs of the Chinese version of the CARD were also found to be significantly associated with other measures that are related to teacher stress such as selfefficacy job satisfaction personal habits to deal with stress and intention to leave their current jobWorking in challenging contexts can impact negatively on a teachers sense of purpose and efficacy This article explores the potential of group Life Design LD a narrative constructivist career counselling process for supporting ten South African school teachers working at an underresourced school with understanding their career aspirations and their personal and professional identity The group LD process formed part of a participatory action learning and action research PALAR project This article focuses on teachers experience of the group LD process Participating teachers reflected in writing and during group discussions on their experience of the LD

reflect on themes from their life narratives to encourage agency for pursuing their future personal and professional goals Through the LD process the teachers acknowledged personal and professional assets from past and present narratives which could motivate them during challenging times The LD process ignited agency for action to achieve career and personal goals Participants designed future life maps and also explored pathways for collectively improving their support to learnersThe subjects that the researchers focus on conflict management in organizations are the way in which conflicts arise the types of conflicts the management strategies of managers and conflict resolution styles When the literature is examined it is seen that the ways of handling conflicts are explained in the framework of two or threedimensional models Though from a theoretical point of view the conflict management styles are static but when conditions change and the dynamic structure of the conflict is taken into consideration it is confronted with what the result of the conflict is To answer the question mentioned above systems archetypes are modelled within the framework of systems thinking There are not enough studies in social sciences related to identification and classification of system archetypes For this reason we attempted to associate conflict management with system archetypes based on the definition of Senge who appended the concept of system archetypes to the literature The resolution that can be emerged in the case of unmanageable conflicts explained by the escalation archetypeThe article reports on the importance of continuing education programs to help prevent teacher burnout Topics mentioned include the study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation on the effects

future research may focus on the role of coaching on teachers professional development and students academic successEach country has a different cultural origins and tendency to shape its future Since Turkeys social economic and geographical conditions differ from those of other countries the Turkish education system also differs from that of other countries Quality education and training occurs through effective communication between institutions teachers students and families However while managing and directing education the teacher is undergoing loss of motivation and inefficiency in school environment In the study we tried to find out and investigate the factors causing loss of motivation for the teachers in language teaching We interviewed eight Language Lecturers teaching English French German Arabic and Turkish Languages at the College of Foreign Language in various universities in Turkey so as to obtain the data We asked three open ended questions to the lecturers in our study What affects your motivation in classroom environment What are the factors that cause loss of motivation for you What do you do to motivate yourself to teach language We used qualitative research method to determine and assess the level of motivation loss and to compare them regarding the gender of the teachers and the students the experiences of the teachers and the kinds of the language The opinions obtained from the lecturers through face to face interview revealed that the implementation of distanteducation in English Language courses indifference of the students to French and German Languages lack of communication inadequate social facilities and the alphabet difference of the students coming from Turkic Republics and Arabian Countries were the main reasons for the factors causing motivation loss of the teachers in language teachingPurpose Teacher empowerment involves investing teachers with the right to participate in the determination of school goals and policies as informed by their professional judgment By empowering teachers teachers can discover their potential and limitations for themselves as well as developing competence in their professional

based on the MUSA method and the continuous genetic algorithm in order to measure job satisfaction The objective is to help organizations evaluate and measure their employees satisfaction Our study is composed of two parts Firstly we propose to combine continuous genetic algorithm and the MUSA method in order to obtain a robust solution of good performance The aim of the development of this algorithm is to verify its efficiency regarding the classical MUSA algorithm Therefore we compare the result of continuous genetic algorithm with that of the MUSA algorithm In the second part we present our Decision Support Systems called GMUSA System it was developed in order to facilitate the applications and the use of the GMUSA tools and overcome the increasing complexity of managerial contexts Our new system GMUSA is applied at the University of Sfax to measure teachers job satisfactionInLaird conducted a study using secondary agricultural education teachers across the United States to determine the depth agricultural mechanics skills were being taught at the time and how important those skills would be inThe researchers conducted a follow up study inusing secondary agricultural education teachers in Iowa as the population This research compares the findings from both Laird and the researchers to form a crosssectional comparison spanningyears between the depth skills that were taught inand the predicted importance of those skills inFindings from this study show that the overall depth of secondary agricultural mechanics instruction has decreased but the importance to teach said skills is increasing Teachers should use this information to prioritize the skills in their curriculum so that the skills with the most perceived importance are being taught in the greatest depthThe purpose of this narrative phenomenological case study was to explore administrator strategies related to teacher retention as perceived by teachers in one Texas charter

limited impact on developing teachers skills One response has been that coaching has been used increasingly in schools sincein a variety of ways However there is a lack of research into the impact of coaching in schools This study explored the impact of specialist coaching and peer cocoaching as perceived by coachees and CPD coordinators The impact of coaching at three different levels was considered benefits at the individual personalemotional level changes to individuals daily practice and benefits at the schoolwideorganizational level Design A postal questionnaire and semistructured interviews were used Methods CPD coordinators inurban mainstream secondary schools completed the questionnaire and identified coachees for interview Semistructured interviews with six of these CPD coordinators and seven coachees were then conducted The interviews were analysed through Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to explore patterns in what the interviewees perceived the benefits of coaching to be Results Peer coaching impacted on all three levels proposed in the study The impact of specialist coaching was found to vary depending on the role of the coachee eg newly qualified teachers and middle leaders benefited differently Conclusions The current study has indicated that coaching is perceived by CPD coordinators and coachees to have a positive impact on teachers daily practice and at the organisational level alongside the benefits it offers to individuals at an emotional levelProfessional Learning Communities PLCs are an important strategy for innovation in schools and they are receiving considerable attention from scholars and educators alike The present study aimed to examine the effect of PLCs on schools effectiveness and to investigate the social organizational and structural factors that can promote these learning communities The survey for this study was completed byteachers fromelementary schools in the Seoul Metropolitan Area of South

and reflection on their teaching interactions with children in three New Zealand early childhood education centres Using stimulatedrecall interviews teaching teams viewed videorecorded episodes of their teaching and discussed their thinking and reflections during and after the episodes Key findings included teachers emphasis in their thinking and reflection on children in comparison to their teaching intentions beliefs and practices The article concludes by presenting a model for understanding New Zealand early childhood teachers thinking and reflections on teaching and learning and the implications for practice emerging from this researchGrounded in Vygotskys culturalhistorical theory this paper examines how often teachers are involved in childrens imaginative play and discusses their beliefs about their role in supporting childrens imaginative play To investigate this problem videohours of digital observations and interview data two hours andminutes ofchildren withteachers from two preschools in Australia were analysed Using VygotskysPlay and Its Role in the Mental Development of the Child Voprosy Psikhologiiculturalhistorical concept of play and Kravtsov and KravtsovasPlay in the LS Vygotskys Nonclassical Psychology Journal of Russian and East European Psychologyconception of subject positioning being inside and outside of the play it was found that despite the general importance of play teachers involvement in developing childrens imaginative play appears to be minimal The interviews showed that teachers beliefs about their role in childrens imaginative play are directly related to the distance of their physical proximity and understanding of the play narrative being enacted This paper argues that focusing on teachers involvement in childrens play is an important but underresearched dimension of playbased pedagogies in early childhood educationThe study investigates direct and indirect preschool quality effects on emergent literacy skills childrens letter knowledge oral skills and interests and skills in print and communication using quality indicators at process ECERSR ECERSE structure eg class size and belief eg support creativity level The study included a sample ofchildren frompreschools and implemented standardised tests and teacherratings in the final preschool year as well as observations and questionnaires throughout the preschool period Multiple regression models reveal that ECERSR was significantly related to childrens teacher rated interest and skills in communication and that ECERSE predicted childrens tested letter knowledge Group size predicted childrens interest and skills in print negatively revealing lower scores in larger groups With regard to beliefs teachers creativity and social support beliefs were negatively related with childrens letter knowledge whereas teachers knowledge and culturaltoolsoriented beliefs were positively related with interest and skills in communication These effects were partly mediated through ECERSE Although the study provides evidence for effects of preschool quality on the development of childrens emergent literacy skills and some evidence that effects of beliefs are partly mediated through process quality effects are not consistent through the outcome variables and effect sizes are smallEducational effectiveness research has provided evidence about the importance of teacher beliefs and attitudes for teaching and learning This study builds on the concept of academic optimism which combinesaspects of a teachers professional creed selfefficacy trust and academic emphasis The study explores the functioning of the collective and individual measures of academic optimism in the Czech environment and studies its impact on students outcomes The analyses are based on pilot data fromschoolsteachers andGradestudents and on the data from the Czech Longitudinal Study in Education CLoSE coveringschoolsteachers andstudents The individual measure was selected for further studies based on level confirmatory factor analysis Twolevel structural equation modelling showed a significant impact of a schools academic optimism on students achievement even after controlling for prior achievement and socioeconomic status at both the student and the school levelThis study describes the beliefs selfreported practices and actual practices related to childcentred education of five female preschool teachers in Ankara Turkey and assesses the consistency between the participants beliefs and practices Data were collected through interviews classroom observations and document review The results indicated that the participant teachers beliefs and practices as expressed through instructional activities relationships behaviour management assessment parental involvement and selfreporting were partially parallel to the childcentred education philosophy Also there was only partial consistency between teachers beliefs about selfreported practices of and actual practices of childcentred educationWhen university faculty and students use technology they do so in a specific context and researchers have acknowledged that in order to understand use or nonuse of technology in higher education they need to account for this However although the importance of context is not questioned there is little consensus over which contexts are relevant and how they interact with an individuals use of technology This article proposes an ecological model for the contexts that influence a university faculty members thinking about technology and uses qualitative case study data to show the wide range of contexts that need to be included in this It argues that a much broader range of contexts needs to be taken into account in any research that investigates faculty thinking perceptions or decisions about using technology and that only considering some of these contexts risks misunderstanding the complex influences on faculty members thinking about their workCollective teacher efficacy CTE beliefs serve to encourage certain behaviours and constrain others Bandura Educ Psycholxrefxref was the first to generate interest in this area by demonstrating that the effect of perceived CTE on student achievement was stronger than the link between socioeconomic status and student achievement The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the productive patterns of behaviour and other consequences resulting from educators shared sense of efficacy Studies showed that CTE was associated with a number of productive behaviours including implementation of school improvement strategies increased teacher leadership communication of high expectations and a strong focus on academic pursuits In addition CTE was associated with other positive factors including greater job satisfaction commitment to students and the teaching profession and positive attitudes toward teaching students with special education needs and professional development Collective efficacy was negatively related to performance goal orientations and positively related to students emotional engagement Finally there were a number of studies that established the relationship between CTE and individual teacher efficacy It is important to acknowledge that the relationship between CTE and other variables included in the studies contained within this review are most likely bidirectional Policy makers system and school leaders and staff developers efforts toward successful education reforms might be better served by strategically and intentionally considering how to foster collective efficacy throughout the conceptualization design delivery and assessment of change initiatives Suggestions for future research and limitations including potential measurement problems of included studies are sharedThis study examines how various teacher characteristics and contextual factors are related to early primary teachers beliefs about mathematical teaching and learning and teachers attitudes toward their own learning of mathematics A total ofearly primary teachers across Nebraska participated in the study Teacher characteristics and contextual factors were grouped into four sets teacher professional background teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching teaching contexts and students experiences Multiple regression analyses were conducted with each set of predictors separately as well as with all four sets together The results showed significant relationships between teachers mathematical knowledge for teaching and teachercentered beliefs motivation in learning mathematics and anxiety toward learning mathematics Teacher certification level the number of college math courses taken and perceived support from colleagues and administrators were also related to some aspects of teachers mathematical beliefs and attitudes The findings suggest the potential role of teachers mathematical knowledge for teaching in improving teachers mathematical beliefs and attitudesStudents with learning disabilities LD often receive instruction in general education science classrooms However little is known about the academic success of students with LD in this setting As inquirybased science instruction has become more prominent research focusing on student learning is needed to explore how such instruction meets students needs To address this a crosscase analysis was conducted It included six middle school students each with LD from a Midwestern city Each student was enrolled in a general education science class that used inquirybased instruction Data sources included student and educator interviews classroom observations and student portfolios Results indicated that most of the students with LD had difficulty acquiring science process knowledge and that students relied on peer supports to facilitate their learning Findings extend the research on science instruction for students with LD in middle school classrooms using inquirybased instructionThe development of cultural awareness in educators ensures that culturally and linguistically diverse students receive culturally responsive practices Because special educators already advocate for their exceptional students they are well suited to advocate for cultural responsiveness in their schools as well The purpose of this article is to outline a framework and case study utilizing this framework for helping special educators push forward their own cultural awareness and actively develop tools they can use for fostering cultural awareness in colleagues The framework uses critically reflective collaborative professional learning communities PLCs Drawing from the research on teacher critical reflection collaborative PLCs and Engestrms theory of expansive learning a case study using the framework was conducted withpracticing teachers Participants read and reflected on critical literature to make visible unexamined beliefs engaged in conversations that pushed them to reflect more deeply and project forward new ideas and set goals for acting as agents of change in schoolsThe purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher value beliefs personal characteristics and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge TPACK in both intervention and nonintervention settings Onehundred and nine inservice teachers from elementary to high schools participate in this study Our findings reveal that compared to personal characteristics teacher value beliefs are the only variable that can significantly predict TPACK across both settings In addition in the nonintervention setting the relations between personal characteristics and TPACK are also moderated by teacher value beliefs How to foster teacher value beliefs around technology integration is discussedThe paper examined whether inservice teachers from Australia to Italy differ in terms of their attitudes concerns efficacy beliefs and intentions to include learners with disabilities in their classrooms An attempt was also made to determine predictors of the participants intentions to include learners with disabilities in their classrooms Participants for the study consisted ofAustralian andItalian inservice teachers Results revealed that Italian teachers had significantly more positive attitudes lower degree of concerns and higher level of intentions to implement inclusion in their classrooms In both countries attitudes and efficacy emerged as significant predictors of participants intentions to include learners with disabilities in regular classrooms Reasons that could explain differences in the teachers beliefs from the two countries are explained using historicalcultural and legal frameworks prevalent in Australia and Italy Implications of the findings for policymakers university teachers and researchers are presented that may have relevance in guiding the implementation of inclusive education in Australia Italy and beyond PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedUsing data from observations in three US preschools nine classrooms total and interviews with nine preschool teachers observed the present qualitative study examines moments of gender socialization through disciplinary interactions in preschool classrooms I ask How do teachers expectations for childrens behaviors and use of disciplinary practices contribute to gender inequality in preschool And how do preschool teachers transmit and do gender through disciplinary practices and interactions Using a grounded theory approach to data analysis I find that in preschool teachers discipline boys and girls differently and create gendered stories about why these differences exist Teachers tell these gendered stories to account for and justify their gendered beliefs expectations and differential treatment of children during disciplinary interactions Preschool teachers gendered beliefs are also associated with gendered disciplinary responses to childrens misbehavior in preschool classrooms My data suggest that teachers gendered beliefs and expectations for behavior are related to how boys and girls are disciplined differently for engaging in the same behaviors I argue that teachers gendered beliefs and gendered disciplinary interactions with children in preschool classrooms contribute to the embodiment and enforcement of gender and gender inequality in early childhood My findings suggest that in preschool gender differences continue to be constructed and reified as natural in young children PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe purpose of this study was to examine how K toteachers defined the concept of text complexity within the context of materials selection Using a tripartite definition of text complexity as our benchmark we found that a majority of participants were unable to adequately define the concept of text complexity Teachers who were able to define text complexity however also considered a wider range of factors in their evaluation of texts for instruction Our findings suggest that developing a firm understanding of text complexity is beneficial to teachers during the materials selection process PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedSuccessful school consultation depends largely on the consultants ability to influence teacher behavior and the teachers receptivity to that influence The goal of this study was to examine correlates of teacher receptivity to social influence strategies within school consultation Participants weregeneral education teachers K recruited through Amazons Mechanical Turk Teachers completed questionnaires that includedthree subscales of the modified ConsulteeTeacher Version of the Interpersonal Power Inventory assessing soft social influence strategies and measures assessingpersonality constructsknowledge of behavior modification and mental health literacyneed for cognition and beliefs about student behavior and interventions andworkrelated stress As expected the subscales of the modified Interpersonal Power Inventory had acceptable internal consistency alphas Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that teacher beliefs need for cognition and the interaction between need for cognition and stress were significantly positively associated with receptivity to positive expert and direct information influences after accounting for personality characteristics These relationships were not found for receptivity to positive referent influences Instead knowledge of behavioral principles was negatively associated with this social influence Results are discussed in relation to consultation research and practice PsycINFO Database Record cAPA

passive participants However students faculty and experts often have distinct definitions of learnercenteredness and the paucity of research comparing perspectives of these different groups must be resolved In the current study our central research question was how do student faculty and expert observer perceptions of learnercenteredness within biology classrooms compare to one another We sampledstudents from fifteen sections of a general biology course for nonmajors and complete responses fromstudents were analyzed Five valid and reliable tools two faculty two student and one expert observer evaluated the learnercenteredness of each participating section Perceptions of learnercentered instructors often aligned with those of expert observers while student perceptions tended not to align with either group Interestingly students perceived learnercentered instructors as less learnercentered if they taught at nontraditional times andor in largeenrollment sections despite their focus on student learning Perceptions of learnercenteredness in the biology classroom are complex and may be best captured with more than one instrument Our findings encourage instructors to be cognizant that the approaches they employ in the classroom may not be interpreted as learnercentered in the same manner by students and external observers particularly when additional course factors such as enrollment and scheduling may encourage negative perceptions of learnercentered practicesThe purpose of this study was to investigate how content area teachers of the deaf integrate writing instruction and factors that impact content area writing practices Integrating writing into the disciplines is currently emphasized in order to support literacy and content learning Teachers of the deaf N responded to a national survey that included the following categories of questions content area writing practices classroom environment and resources diverse learners and teachers beliefs Even though the majority of teachers believed writing to be important for success in their disciplines and feasible to integrate into their classrooms they reported that teaching students with delayed expressive and receptive language diverse reading levels and limited knowledge of academic language presented challenges Content area teachers of the deaf could benefit from professional development focused on the integration of guided writing practices that offer greater language and literacy support for deaf and hard of hearing students PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedLearning to teach is a complex process that hinges on teacher candidates personal experiences values beliefs and characteristics as well as the contexts they are exposed to Student teaching as a transitional period may create dilemmas for teacher candidates who are new to the profession and still learning about what it means to be a teacher Thus this study examined the dilemmas experienced by a group of Taiwanese teacher candidates during the student teaching phase Using the framework of dilemmatic spaces we identified the sources of their dilemmas and the decisions they made towards the dilemmatic situations and further examined how they justified their decisions Our findings suggest that conflicting ideologies and teacher candidates identities as student teachers are the main sources of their dilemmas In response to the dilemmas teacher candidates showed different decisionmaking trajectories that revealed the different actions and justifications they took within the dilemmatic spaceData driven pedagogy has been introduced into Australian schools over the last decade to improve student learning outcomes but are teacher educators preparing preservice teachers to be data literate We used a survey to investigate readytograduate preservice teachers beliefs regarding their knowledge and skills in data literacy Before entering a course on data literacy their belief responses indicated that they had basic data interpretation knowledge but they were unsure of how to translate that knowledge into the classroom to improve student outcomes The survey was administered again after a data literacy course which included a fiveweek supervised professional experience task of observing data being used in schools to drive pedagogy The postcourse survey responses showed students increased confidence in their ability to interpret and use data suggesting that a data literacy course linked to the professional experience task improves teachers sense of preparedness to use data in the classroom Keywords Data literacy professional learningThe success of new pedagogies depends on teachers beliefs about what they entail and the promises and challenges they hold This study uses a mixedmethods approach to understand the beliefs of early childhood teachers who attended a professional development conference on STEAM teaching an emerging approach that combine STEM disciplines and the arts through problembased learning to engage students and push deep thinking Data from a postconference survey N and followup interviews N showed teachers varied in their beliefs about STEAM and the supports they needed to implement it successfully Implications for teacher education are discussedOver the last few years the effect that teachers beliefs have on the results achieved by their students has been widely studied Educational research has shown that the selfefficacy beliefs of teachers in their work influence their professional behavior and are associated with students achievement and motivation The main aim of this work is to study the personal and contextual factors determining the level of selfefficacy perceived by teachers in countries of the European Union which participated in TALISSpecifically it attempts to answer the following questions What are the main determinants of teachers selfefficacy beliefs Are these factors individual or contextual Do these determinants vary from country to country Taking into account the multistructural level of available data teachers Levelare nested within schools Levelin each country data analysis has been carried out by means of multilevel structural equation modeling More specifically a multigroup multilevel model has been designed to study the effect of teachers traits Levelpredictors and school traits Levelpredictors on the perceived level of selfefficacy in different countries The results show that variables relating to the teachers as professionals cooperation with their colleagues encouraging selfevaluation by the students teachers perception of satisfactory class discipline a need for professional development in the contents of the subject taught and in teaching skills and having a constructivist teaching approach are the ones most closely related to their selfefficacy beliefs These are more important than factors associated with the institutional setting in which they work ownership ratio or shortage of resources or strictly personal traits age gender or work situationThis article studies the role of photography in the professional development of teachers The first results of the research project are presented here Three teachers and a director of three primary schools participated in it during two academic years The teachers used photography to represent their main concerns and the professional dilemmas they encountered during their work Issues that subsequently were shared and debated on in groups through photoelicitation sessions The reflection on these events brought forth their theoreticalpractical knowledge and the emotions they experienced The relationship between the mental images of the teachers in these situations and how they materialized through photographs is analyzed and discussed in this paper The results show the relevant role of rhetorical figures especially metonymy to understand the semiotic process of conceptualization and meaning of objects and events of the reality lived in the classrooms and their photographic representation In addition the analysis and deliberation during the photoelicitation on the images taken allowed the teachers to carry out a deliberative process and to reassign meanings regarding their actions in the classrooms This in turn entailed a change and transformation of their teaching practice that to a large extent is a key aspect of their professional developmentThe present study is part of a broader investigation developed within the framework of a national RD project in which several Spanish universities participated Its main objective was to recover the expert knowledge of professors emeriti that is to reconstruct the personal and professional processes followed by professors who have been very relevant in the world of teaching and research This study presents and interprets the answers expressed byprofessors emeriti fromSpanish public universities regarding the processes of change reform innovation andor educational improvement which Spanish universities have undergone Using semistructured interviews we try to access to the personal vision of professors emeriti Their answers to the questions that we have raised were analyzed through content analysis Many considerations insights and recommendations worthy of being taken into consideration derive from this analysis We will refer in particular to their beliefs and insights regarding the transformations that took place in Spanish universities throughout the period that covers the professional career of these professors emeriti In this article the author presents an understanding of how brain works to help teachers reform their teaching style for effective educational outcome Teachers should improvise when they face problems for which their education leaves them unprepared He suggests that the teachers should be required to learn some basic principles of psychology as part of their education to have better results from their studentsTechnical and vocational education and training TVET plays an important role in economic development due to is its main orientation towards the world of work UNESCO TVET Strategy and the emphasis of the curriculum on the acquisition of employable skills Its considered to be a tool for productivity enhancement and poverty reduction at a global level Europecommunication EU The dynamics of change in TVET in recent years has generated new perspectivesapproaches regarding the role of the teacher and hisher responsibilities on the one hand and on the other hand a request for increasing the quality of initial teacher training Maclean R Pavlova MET Working Group on Schools PolicyThese changes have led to a growing need to adapt the initial teacher training programs in TVET to the current labor market requirements The quality of teachers in TVET is reflected in the quality of graduates training and reflects on all stakeholders Thus the teachers role in TVET is essential in achieving quality education and especially in supportingcoordinating students in the transition process from school to the labor market The low performances of TVET graduates relative to basic skills and the situation on the labor market compared to the low level of achieved specialized competencies cast doubt on the quality of TVET in general and on the skills of TVET teachers in particular This paper presents a study on the initial training of TVET teachers worldwide also taking into account some countries in Europe among these Romania The characteristics of the teaching profession in TVET focusing on the specific competencies for TVET are highlighted as well as the specificity of TVET in common competences Also the paper presents the implications of new changes new learning approaches new technologies in hiring companies etc on the role of TVET teachers and competency profiles The paper aims at updating the competencies of TVET teachers and proposes an analysis of the assessment in the graduation exams of the training programs The article is based on a documentary study of some specialized papers on the initial teacher education The results of the study are reflected in the outline of an uptodate competency model for TVET teachers taking into account its rapid pace of development and in making a critical analysis of how the final evaluation is achieved within the initial training programsThe article offers information to understand the gender gap that exists according to their reading

disabilities Participants were six physical education teachers from schools located in the city of Braslia Brazil The research paradigm was descriptivequalitative situated in the theory of planned behaviour The primary data source was a focus group interview Interview data were analysed with constant comparative method and uncovered four major recurrent themes The first major theme exposes the teachers beliefs that their class arrangements were typically integrative not inclusive Second the teachers practices were distressed with problems and concerns beyond those of a typical physical education programme Third the teachers selfefficacy in teaching students with disabilities depended largely on several salient variables Lastly the teachers were mostly intrinsically motivated in teaching students with disabilities School districts should engage teachers in professional development focused on teaching students with disabilities in physical educationThis article describes how it is due to the fact that computer science is present in many activities of daily life students need to develop skills to solve problems to improve the lives of people in general This article investigates correlations between teachers motivational orientations beliefs and practices with respect to the application of realworld problems in undergraduate courses A questionnaire was applied to twentyeight teachers of an undergraduate computer science course Data from the questionnaire was analyzed using statistical methods The results show that the majority of the teachers especially those who interact with companies believe that the insertion of realworld problems in the classroom is important However some teachers are not willing to adopt this practice This is linked to reasons such as the need for more flexible curricula and a better teaching qualification with respect to collaborative problem solvingThis study examined the relationship between school leaders instructional

teachers beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning on mathematics teaching anxiety The predictive correlational survey model was utilized in this study We used mathematicsrelated beliefs scale and mathematics teaching anxiety scale in the study to collect the data The data were analysed using structural equation model The results of the study demonstrated that traditional beliefs did not affect the subfactors of the mathematics teachingrelated anxiety scale On the other hand the results showed that constructivist beliefs directly negatively affect anxiety about selfconfidence regarding mathematics teaching and anxiety about mathematics teaching attitude Another finding was that constructivist beliefs directly affect anxiety about content knowledge regarding mathematics teaching and also negatively affect this anxiety through anxiety about selfconfidence Similarly constructivist beliefs directly affect the anxiety about pedagogical content knowledge regarding mathematics teaching while also affecting this anxiety negatively through anxiety about mathematics teaching attitude When the variance rates of the final model were evaluated constructivist beliefs anxiety about selfconfidence regarding mathematics teaching anxiety about mathematics teaching attitude and anxiety about content knowledge can account forof the variance in anxiety about pedagogical content knowledgeThis study aims to explore the factors influencing teaching performance in mathematics With the samplemathematics teachers in Yogyakarta region Indonesia selected by the balanced

theoretical and practical perspectives in which theoretically it supports the Indonesian government regulation in providing teaching services within educational system The result revealed there are five core potentials in assisting the teaching performance Those are knowledge attitude skills beliefs of mathematics and certification It can be reflected by the lesson planning construct learning procedure and the connection between personalities in the sense that constructs the relation to other subjects education and curriculum and teaching and education Towards pedagogical professional personal and social skills this initiative refers to strengthen the beliefs construct among knowledge education and selfconfidence in assisting the teaching performanceThis study was designed to extend our knowledge of the differences between EFL teachers beliefs of effective instruction and their actual classroom practices under the influence of different factors in the Vietnamese context The paper took a qualitative approach using focus group discussion journaling nonparticipant observation and postobservation individual interviews as data gathering tools Findings from this study indicate a wide gap that existed between what was believed and what was actually implemented by experienced teachers Participating teachers valued and were actually aware of the benefits of interactive activities to students communication skills However they adopted teachercentred GTMoriented instruction in the classroom The study teachers perceptions of students factors traditional educational values and norms physical working constraints family roles and emotion appeared to affect their teaching practices in the classroom This research has the potential to inform teacher development in Vietnam and in similar settings with the view to improving the quality of English teaching and learningThe aim of this research is to examine the teacher candidates views of the nature of science and their problemsolving skills in terms of various variables and the relationship between them ScienceTechnologySociety Scale VOSTS developed by Aikenhead RyanFlemingand adapted by Arthrough choosingitems VOSTSTR and Problem Solving Inventory PSI developed by HeppnerPetersonand adapted by ahin ahinHeppnerwere used as data collection instruments While teacher candidates views differed in the subdimension of the VOSTSTR their level of problem solving skills was found to be medium and high According to twoway ANOVA results the interaction of problem solving skills between gender does not create a significant difference on teacher candidates views of nature of science and its characteristic features of scientific information subdimension However the interaction of problem solving skills between educational stage that they will serve create a significant differences on teacher candidates views of nature of science Teacher candidates views of the nature of science were significantly predicted by their problem solving skills In conclusion the teacher candidates views of the nature of science are not at a sufficient level and their views of the nature of science affected by problem solving skillsTeacher reflection is a salient activity which can assist teachers in getting a critical view about their effective teaching LoughranAmong various factors

teachers and improving in this direction is important in increasing students learning and demonstrating their performance In this research the aim was to identify the classroom assessment practices used by primary secondary and high school teachers Survey and observation form were used to collect the data for the research The study group consisted ofteachers From the results of the research it has been concluded that teachers had adopted an approach of assessment for learning for the purpose of making the assessment Teachers have used largely traditional assessment methods in classroom assessment practices Teachers identified the main factor influencing classroom assessment processes as student characteristics but it was discovered that they did not reflect this situation in their practices It is suggested that teachers use alternative assessment methods that center on student selfassessments and the diversity in the assessment methods to be increased to ensure fairnessConsidering the significant position of critical pedagogy in teaching English as a foreign language there is a need for indepth investigations of novice teachers professional identity construction through the interaction with critical notions introduced in teacher education programs As the impact of such programs on novice teachers professional identity in an EFL context has remained underexplored this study intends to address the gap This study examines the role of a teacher education program informed by the principles of critical pedagogy in influencing novice EFL teachers professional identity construction Participants werenovice EFL teachers whose process of professional identity construction was analysed through reflective journals class discussions and semistructured interviews before and after the program Results of the study revealed two major shifts in participants professional identity Before the program their identity was characterized by an attitude of compliance and a narrow view of EFL teaching However after the program they developed voice and adopted a humanistic conception of teaching Finally in order to facilitate the cultivation of critical ideas in EFL novice teachers the study recommends the use of dialogic discussions and written reflective tasks in teacher education programsThis study investigates the relationship

changes in their conceptions about these activities affect their beliefs about mathematics The sample comprisedmathematics teachers working in small groups in four modelling activities The data were collected from teachers Reports about features of each activity interviews and questionnaires on teachers beliefs about mathematics The findings indicated changes in teachers conceptions about the modelling activities Most teachers referred to the first activity as a mathematical problem but emphasized only the mathematical notions or the mathematical operations in the modelling process changes in their conceptions were gradual Most of the teachers referred to the fourth activity as a mathematical problem and emphasized features of the whole modelling process The results of the interviews indicated that changes in the teachers conceptions can be attributed to structure of the activities group discussions solution paths and elicited models These changes about modelling activities were reflected in teachers beliefs about mathematics The quantitative findings indicated that the teachers developed more constructive beliefs about mathematics after engagement in the modelling activities and that the difference was significant however there was no significant difference regarding changes in their traditional beliefsMathematics education research has given increasing attention to the role of affective factors in the learning process While affect is used to refer to a variety of aspects including feelings emotions beliefs attitudes and conceptions this paper focuses on beliefs of elementary preservice teachers In particular the study evaluates the effect of participation in a reformbased elementary preservice teacher education referred to as Initial Teacher Education ITE programme on participants beliefs about the nature of mathematics This was completed using two subscales of the Aikens Revised Mathematics Scale measuring Enjoyment of Mathematics E and belief in the Value of Mathematics V Both scales were administered before and after participants completed the mathematics education programme which consisted ofcompulsory and consecutive modules This study reveals that entrylevel preservice teachers report generally positive beliefs about the value of and enjoyment in doing mathematics The findings challenge previous research which report the tendency of teachers beliefs to be resistant to change while in teacher education and suggest that it is possible for ITE mathematics education programmes to stimulate improvement in beliefs and attitudes among participants Particular programme features are identified as instrumental in this positive change in beliefs about mathematicsTo achieve the purpose of inquiry learning approaches and models it is necessary to identify the difficulties encountered because the science teacher candidates have key prescriptions Therefore the aim is to reflect fruitful and high level critical views at the end of the process providing them different learning difficulties using different learning models and approaches at every stages For this purpose qualitative research method was used in the study conducted withcandidates selected from easily accessible case sample among the thirdgrade students attending the undergraduate program of science teacher education Openended form was prepared as a data collection tool and the data were generated using content analysis Finally the answers given by the teacher candidates are thematized as advantages disadvantages cognitive domain skills affective domain SETSE dimension TQF The codes generated under the themes vary according to the applied model and approach The nature of science team work and discussion culture code were most evident in CMCK While the STS code was on the forefront in E model the engineering and design skills code was found to be at a high level in STEM implementationProviding interdisciplinary learning opportunities in agriculture food natural resources AFNR and science is critically important Schoolbased agricultural education offers a valuable platform to connect AFNR and science however interdisciplinary teaching requires willing and able teachers The current study considered the intentions of schoolbased agriculture teachers to teach science within AFNR curriculum Using the theory of planned behavior attitude toward teaching science subjective norms perceived behavioral control and perceived science knowledge were considered as independent variables to teaching science within AFNR curriculum The explanatory model was analyzed using structural equation modeling In total schoolbased agriculture teachers intended to teach science inof AFNR curriculum Only perceived science knowledge was a statistically significant negative predictor of intended science teaching Findings pinpoint the need for additional research into the unexpected relationship between perceived science knowledge and science teaching intentions The need and nature of potential explorations along with specific recommendations for practice are discussedThe relevance of experiential learning and opportunities a school farm can provide along with the acknowledgment of potential barriers and the current deficit of research on school farms in Oregon make this study useful as a starting point in this line of exploration and in the preparation of teacher candidates This study intended to gather descriptive data concerning school farms to gain a better understanding of the characteristics uses perceptions and barriers to utilizing school farms as an experiential learning tool for students Williams and McCarthyindicated utilizing school farms as a teachinglearning resource could benefit agricultural education programs and Rosesuggested we begin to reconsider how the school and workplace are connected Approximately half of the agricultural education teachers in Oregon have access to a school farm The primary facilities available on Oregon school farms were for equipment and tool storage and animal projects with SAE and laboratory instruction being the main uses for students Factors and barriers consist of the condition of the school farm facilities finances and the ability of the teacher to oversee and to engage all students in the activityThis study sought to identify traits and characteristics of secondary agricultural education programs contributing to success A three round modified Delphi survey technique was utilized to frame this study The researchers utilized purposive sampling to select members for the jury comprised of secondary agricultural instructors identified as high quality n High quality programs were determined based on the results of various activities and competitions a program would participate in including CDEs LDEs Agriscience Fair Divisions State Fair livestock shows State Officer Elections and National Chapter Awards Data collected identified important factors associated with high performing SAE programs and that students should be actively involved with an SAE project Additionally important factors included that students should experience some kind of personal growth as they develop through a program and that students should be taught and prepared so they are able to take part in both program activities and eventually a career The FFA program should be operated so that it is molding students into productive members of society The FFA advisor should also be passionate and have a willingness and availability to work with members Success does not only rely on instructors but is also dependent upon studentsWe describe a major transformation in teaching large introductory courses in the sciences and engineering at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign impacting overstudents yearly The transformation was emergent not prescribed and occurred through two programs that included both engineering and science departments Working collaboratively in Communities of Practice CoPs made up of a small number of faculty and teaching professionals formed within departments faculty adopted and implemented evidencebased instructional practices with the goal of sustaining them over time To make the reform process understandable to research faculty we adopted the adage of teach like you do research meaning not only using iterative evidencebased decision making but also engaging in a scholarly collaborative community that pushes each individual member toward excellence Another essential feature of the reform was embedding faculty members within the CoPs who had both knowledge of and a track record of implementing evidencebased reforms in their courses to serve as resources to the CoP We describe the coursereform process and lessons learned and provide evidence for the success of our effortsGraduate teaching assistants TAs play an important role in undergraduate programs in our Earth Science Department A course on teaching and learning was developed to train graduate students in studentcentered pedagogy in a disciplinespecific context The training course has been running for a decade and has been taken by overgraduate students This article describes the development of the course and investigates the impact on graduate students beliefs about science teaching and learning Responses to the Beliefs About Reformed Science Teaching and Learning survey indicate that students who have taken the course hold beliefs that are more consistent with researchbased principles of how people learn about science than students who have not taken the course Data from course evaluations and pre and postcourse surveys demonstrate that taking the course also improves confidence in teaching ability and impacts graduate students approaches to teaching and their own learning This course offers effective pedagogical training that gives graduate students the tools to develop and improve their teaching both as TAs and as future faculty membersThe aim of this study was to provide insight into the current practice of writing instruction in Dutch primary education as a stepping stone for designing and implementing sustainable innovations that could satisfy both practitioners and policymakers We investigated the extent to which three domainspecific approachescommunicative writing process writing and writing strategy instructionand general features of highquality instruction were implemented in writing lessons in the upper grades of primary schools We also examined the learning time for writing teachers views on writing and writing instruction how efficacious they feel about teaching writing and how skilled they are in the writing instruction domain Lastly we explored relations between classroom practices learning time and teachers beliefs and skills through correlation analysis to identify potential aids and constraints to guide innovations in writing education Participants wereteachers ofprimary schools in the Netherlands Data were collected through questionnaires stimulated recall interviews and overlesson observations Results indicated that the three domainspecific approaches for writing instruction were insufficiently implemented in Dutch classrooms as were differentiating and the teaching of learning strategies The allocated learning time was also insufficient but the realized learning time and the extent to which teachers promoted active learning were satisfactory providing a strong basis for curricular improvement Several relations were found between teachers classroom practices learning time and teachers beliefs and skills in the domain of writing instruction Finally we discuss options for sustainable innovations of writing instruction in this national contextThe current study examined the influence of students openness to multiculturalism on the frequency of integrating Online Collaborative Learning OCL The mediating variables were attitudes toward benefits of OCL negative aspects of OCL and challenges of OCL The participants wereICT coordinators who are also subject teacherscoordinators had participated in at least one OCL training programandcoordinators had notThe questionnaire was based on previous ones and compriseditems Path analysis findings indicate that the negative aspects of OCL were a very significant mediating factor in the model affecting the paths between openness to multiculturalism and experiencing the challenges of OCL and the frequency of the integration of OCL Furthermore for ICT coordinators who had taken part in the OCL programs and saw openness toward multiculturalism among their students there was little impact when there were complex challenges in the OCL It may be that educating toward multiculturalism leads to an atmosphere of openness and egalitarianism to better interpersonal relations and social skills in the class and so they summon fewer frustrating situations in OCL This is an atmosphere that assures collaboration and attainment of positive learning resultsThis study aimed to investigate structural relationships between TPACK teacher selfefficacy perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness for preservice teachers who intend to use technology based on the Technology Acceptance Model TAM A total ofresponses from the College of Education from three Korean universities were analyzed by employing the structural equation modeling methods The results indicated that preservice teachers TPACK significantly affected teacher selfefficacy and perceived ease of using technology The teachers TPACK also positively influenced their perceived ease of using technology and perceived usefulness of technology in the classroom Finally teacher selfefficacy perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of using technology affected teachers intention to use technology However TPACK did not directly affect their intention to use technology Based on the findings we discuss implications and suggest future research directions for preservice teachers intention to use technologyObjective We assessed the level and source of

Bachelors degree was the highest qualification reported byof participants Seventytwo percent of the teachers had either very goodor goodknowledge about ADHD Almost half of them reported multiple sources such as internet social media and television for obtaining information about ADHD However internet and social media alone were reported as a source of information byandrespectively Those who attended any course on ADHD had significantly P more knowledge about the disorder Furthermore those teachers having taught a child with ADHD had more knowledge about the disorder A significant correlation between mean knowledge and attitude scores was observed Conclusion Twothird of the teachers had knowledge about ADHD Those who had either attended a course or taught a child with the ADHD had significantly more knowledge about the disorder Most of the teachers learned about the disorder from multiple sourcesTeachers are important socializers and provide students with experiences to further promote their socialemotional competences or shift their pathways towards emotional and behavioral difficulties These experiences may vary depending on teachers perceptions of their own emotional intelligence EI and beliefs about social and emotional learning SEL implementation However teachers perceptions of EI and SEL cannot be meaningfully understood without consideration of their cultural values The present study examined differences in US and Greek preschool teachers perceptions of their own EI and SEL beliefs and used these teacher perceptions and beliefs to predict preschool students emotional and behavioral difficulties for each cultural group Goals were to examine whetherUS and Greek preschool teachers perceptions of EI and SEL vary by cultural group andteachers perceptions of EI and SEL relate to students emotional and behavioral difficulties and these relations vary by cultural group Participants werepreschool teachers from the United States andpreschool teachers from Greece The study provided evidence for the culturalrelativity of EI and SEL dimensions and indicated that teachers perceptions of EI and SEL selectively predict students difficulties in either population Discussion focuses on cultural considerations in shaping teachers perceptions of EI and SEL beliefsThe purpose of this qualitative study was to understand how undergraduate and graduatelevel choristers perceived the influence of adolescent female voice change on their singing experiences since the age ofyears old Data included individual and focus group interviews withfemale collegiate choral singers enrolled in one of two womens choirs at a large midwestern university Three overarching themes emerged perceptions of vocal development teacher influence and emotion Findings revealed that participants perceptions of singing experiences since agelargely revolved around vocal challenges fear and insecurity and have remained mostly negative even after the passing of time Experiences in choir were not necessarily positive and participants perceived their individual vocal needs as secondary to the needs of the larger choral ensemble Out of fear of hurting the larger choir participants remained passive and did not selfadvocate resulting in additional challenges with selfconfidence and struggles pertaining to singer identity development during adolescence and into adulthoodTeacher preparation programs face a significant challenge in determining how to design learning experiences that develop the combination of knowledge practices and dispositions needed for effective classroom teaching Time constraints and the theorypractice divide are two welldocumented concerns We introduce the conceptual framework and design elements of a videoenhanced mathematics methods course that targets these concerns The course centers on systematic reflection and analysis of practice intended to foster careerlong learning We then examine the impact of this course on several facets of learningfromteaching competencies including teacher knowledge beliefs and practices Sixtytwo preservice teachers enrolled in a oneyear postbachelor elementary teacher preparation program were randomly assigned to attend this course or a more typical mathematics methods course Findings suggest that teacher preparation experiences centered on systematic reflection and analysis create opportunities to develop certain aspects of learningfromteaching competencies that remain otherwise underdeveloped Implications for the design of teacher preparation include the integration in mathematics methods courses of cycles of analysis through videoenhanced discussions collaborative planning implementation and reflection on teaching and live observation and coconstructed interpretations and considerations of next stepsThe nature of literacy as a sociocultural phenomenon has undergone regular and continuous changes With the increase in information and communication technologies the meaning of literacy has been extended to online reading and content creating from traditional printed material based reading and writing These changes have brought about a rapid increase of information and communication technology usage rates To be literate today requires new skills strategies practices and dispositions as well as reading and writing skills based on traditional printed materials In the light of these developments the lowercase and Uppercase New Literacies Theory has emerged in order to explain and examine todays literacy which involves many perspectives The purpose of the current study is to review the new literacy theoretical framework give information about recent research trends in new literacy and make some suggestions to policymakers researchers and teachers In accordance with this purpose i the duallevel new literacy theory is examined ii online reading and writing research in recent years is looked at iii information about technology integration in literacy education is given iv the concept of the digital divide is discussed and finally v various research and practice recommendations are introducedIn this study it is aimed to investigate the present conditions of preschool teachers about the field of astronomy from various points The study group constitutespreschool teachers who are working in Central District of Mus Province In this study one of the qualitative research designs the case study was used The data of the study were obtained using openended questionnaire withquestions The data were analyzed by using the content analysis technique As a result of the analyzes the concepts such as earth sun moon stars astronaut space and alien come to the top of astronomy concepts that children are most curious about Teachers found themselves partially satisfied about astronomy subjects due to the inadequacy of science education courses taken during undergraduate education Furthermore most teachers do not find astronomy activities adequate in preschool education programs Therefore most teachers plan their own activities that are not in the preschool education program Finally teachers use figurespictures earth model nightday modeling telescope modeling and video shows while associating astronomy with daily life There results suggest increasing the number of astronomy activities in the preschool education program Also more attention should be given to science education courses as a part of preschool teacher education undergraduate programs and more attention should be paid to the subjects of astronomy in science education coursesThis paper shares the voices of six teachers regarding two language awareness projects carried out in one preprimary and one primary school in Portugal These projects present innovative practices in teaching young and very young learners to reflect upon language and linguistic diversity and to become aware of world issues eg poverty discrimination and climate changes Based upon interviews conducted with the teachers after the staging of the two projects we analyse teachers discourses regarding the learning outcomes of the activities their beliefs and knowledge about language awareness and the possibilities for including this approach in the curriculum Results suggest that teachers acknowledge the relevance of language awareness in the education of more engaged and respectful citizens however they feel insecure and unprepared to include it in their teaching practice and in their professional knowledge Implications of these findings for preservice and inservice teacher education are discussedThe article examines how literacy educators can recognize and address bias and microaggressions when they occur and the effect bias have on student achievement and wellbeing Topics discussed include definition of implicit bias by the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity explanation on the schema theory and experience of the author as an instructor when working with a large group of seventh graders in a rural community in northern VermontBrain drain is a contextbased issue and has direct impact on the quality of higher education for institutions where a significant number of instructors migrate to take up work in other countries This is a critical problem in Yemen where higher teacher education programmes still lack teachers Interpretive analysis of indepth interviews with two university administrators and ten teacher educators revealed four key factors affecting the occurrence of brain drain ineffective application of sabbatical leave regulations failure to equalize returning teachers salaries with those of their colleagues lack of resources to support research and the presence of internal and external conflicts The study also provides insights for decreasing brain drain in YemenThis twoyear longitudinal study explores how an earlier international teaching experience influences the way six newly qualified teachers perceive their current teaching practice and professional selfunderstanding during personally significant experiences The concept of an experiential continuum a key concept in these findings suggests that every experience reflects back on previous experiences and modifies later experiences We identifiedindividual examples of personally significant experiences in which newly graduated teachers described how their previous international teaching experience informed their present teaching practice Our study shows that experiential continuity identified during significant personal experiences in newly qualified teachers teaching practice influences them when interpretingprofessional beliefs regarding teaching knowledgemoral questions regarding the teacher they want to be or become andtheir international teaching experience as a tool for placing new experiences in perspective The study describes practical cases of how experiential continuity can help newly qualified teachers to understand why they make certain personal or moral interpretations in their teaching induction phase and what this means for the teacher they want to becomeThis paper examines the research selfefficacy beliefs research motivation and perceptions of research importance and research obstacles ofprofessors and lecturers of foreign languages at three Mexican universities Survey results show that faculty hold moderate to high research selfefficacy beliefs are highly motivated to conduct research think research in the area is very important and perceive that lack of time is the main obstacle to conducting research The lack of fit between most participants relatively high selfefficacy and limited research engagement suggests the possibility that faculty overestimate their research abilities The implications of these findings are also discussedThe present article reports on a study that set out to investigate the effectiveness of strategies and decisions formulated in foreign language planning to ensure learners language achievement in a higher education context which trains learners to become English or French teachers or translators By drawing on data collected from simulated proficiency tests and interviews with students teachers and administrators the findings show that the foreign language goals have not been met as stipulated in the curriculum and that there are several shortcomings in the foreign language planning that need the educational communitys consideration This article also discusses some factors that should be considered in foreign language planning in order to meet language goals in educational contextsThis paper presents one Colombian university English as a foreign language programs inhouse teacher development program for curriculum renewal This program is an innovative attempt to prepare teachers for implementing a new curriculum and simultaneously engages them in professional development activities The program is a response to the lack of existing teacher and professional development models that fit certain specific contextual needs including preparation for implementing new curriculum as well as emphases in the updating of particular teaching practices In addition to presenting the program the article also describes the integration of key aspects of various existing models of teacher and professional development into one program that meets contextual needs while encouraging positive change among faculty and studentsReforms to support and expand personalized learning increasingly are being introduced in middle schools across the United States Personalization as enacted in response to these reforms encourages teachers to implement many practices that long have been recommended by advocates of middle grades philosophy To better understand the practices of middle grades teachers working in schools attempting to implement personalized learning this article presents a survey instrument to measure teacher practices for personalization in the middle grades The article describes the formulation and initial administrations of the survey toteachers inandteachers inExploratory factor analysis provided evidence for the presence of factors describing practices for personalized assessment outofschool learning whole group learning in a personalized setting and technology implementation Confirmatory factor analysis with the followup sample provided additional support for this structure Data from these two separate survey administrations demonstrated high internal consistency and moderate correlation across the groups of practices Suggestions for future research using the tool are offered The survey instrument is included as an appendixTeacher expectancy effects the class of phenomena in which teacher beliefs about students influence student outcomes are widely believed to operate through recursive processes of teacherstudent interaction Recent work in wise interventions has shown profound and robust effects in educational domains and has attributed these effects to similar recursive processes Yeager and Walton xrefxref In this paper we lay a foundation for forging connections between what we know about expectancy effects and how we might envision applying that knowledge as a lever in intervention research We review the evidence for the existence and significance of teacher expectancy effects as well as their possible mediators including perceptual biases confirmation biases stereotyping and attributional biases We also hypothesize that empathy could play a role in mediating a relationship between expectancies and attributions Finally we propose a research agenda focused on the transmission mediation and attributional effects of teacher expectanciesEducational inequalities may be derived from differential teacher expectations toward students from different backgrounds Such expectations may be associated with stereotypical beliefs and attitudes which guide behavior and judgments Although ample research is available concerning differential teacher attitudes based on student ethnicity few studies have considered the effect of the educational level of the parents The aim of the current study was to investigate teachers implicit and explicit attitudes toward students with differentially educated parents Implicit attitudes were measured using an implicit association task IAT The first name of the student was used as a proxy for the educational level of parents whereby we created separate versions for boys and girls Participants were randomly divided in two groups whereby the first group completed the IATboys version and the other group the IATgirls version Explicit attitudes were measured using a questionnaire Participants indicated positive implicit attitudes toward students with highly educated parents independent of the gender of the student Teachers did not express differential explicit beliefs regarding the learning and social behaviors of students based on the educational level of the parents and their expectations concerning the motivation and ambitions or educational chances of these students were neutral The dissociation between implicit and explicit attitudes may be an indication of the social sensitivity of the relationship between students social background and educational achievements and opportunities Especially implicit attitudes may account for differences in teacher behaviors toward different groups of students and in turn their educational opportunities and could therefore partly account for consistent findings of educational inequalities based on the social status of familiesAn introduction to articles published within the issue is presented on topics including the hybridity of practices coproduced by teachers students and their teaching settings changes in teachers beliefs and factors that shaped cooperating teacher practice and the relationship to the preservice field experienceIn this article we present two case studies of firstyear secondary science teachers who participated in an urban teacher residency We adopt a situated analysis approach framed by rhizomatics a nonlinear theory of social activity to investigate the ways they attempted to enact practices consistent with the inquirybased social justice focus of their preprofessional program Our investigation was guided by the question How do two science teachers construct their instructional practices in their first year of teaching We argue that the practices that emerged for both teachers were shaped by negotiations between the teacher her students and other contextual factors As such teaching practices are not a direct product of teacher learning but are rather coconstituted by multiple elements and therefore are fundamentally hybrid Such insights add to the extant body of research on the relationship between teacher learning and practice and can assist in developing teacher preparation programs that can support the nonlinear multiplicitous and relational nature of teachingTeachers beliefs about teaching and learning are constructed over a lifetime of experiences in classrooms This nineyear longitudinal study examines preservice teachers initial educational beliefs and the changes in those beliefs over their teacher preparation program and into their first six years of teaching Analysis of questionnaires interviews and surveys from six teachers revealed that they initially believed that students were similar to themselves that students in the same grade have similar abilities that teaching was simple and that teachers function autonomously Nine years later they believed that students differ from one another and from themselves that differentiating instruction is essential but difficult that teaching is complex and that teaching is often constrained by outside factors The data suggested a common progression from initial idealism to cognitive dissonance to a search for an authentic teaching persona to confidence in their new role as teacher and then to diminished idealismThis study examined how teachers read cases in a professional development academy for reading teachers It drew on reading theory particularly Tierney and Pearsonswork on textbased and readerbased readings of traditional printbased text to analyze conversations about cases where a specific focus on pedagogical decisionmaking got lost Using two vignettes the article traces how such unfulfilled case discussions were discursively produced In the first instance the shift away from analysis of pedagogical decision making developed when participants moved toward a particularitybased reading of the case emphasizing its uniqueness in ways that made subsequent analysis appear irrelevant In the second instance the shift emerged from a normbased reading in which dialogue about overarching pedagogical beliefs submerged talk about local specific aspects of the pedagogical decision making in the case at hand Notably such readings appeared to be collaboratively constructed and professional developers often participated in the shift toward particularitybased and normbased readings The article closes by proposing ways in which professional developers might be respectful of and responsive to particularitybased and normbased readings that appear within professional development conversations about cases but also draw teacher attention to the specifics of pedagogical decision making in the cases discussedStudies examining teaching as a career choice tend to focus on the differences between gender or study programmerelated factors when looking at the participants motivations for choosing teaching as an occupation Only a few studies have examined the relationship between subjectrelated differences and career choice motivations This article therefore aims to analyse n German student teachers motivations for choosing teaching as a career with reference to their subject choice Students are in their first semester and enrolled in study programmes to become lower andor upper secondary school teachers The findings indicate small differences between different subject groups but show variance based on the study programme in combination with the subject groupsAs the diversity of American schools is increasing teachers should understand the role culture plays in the classroom and employ teaching practices that accommodate students from diverse cultural backgrounds However while more is known about preservice teachers beliefs about multicultural education less is known about what practices inservice teachers endorse and what factors influence those beliefs about practices Specifically the aims of the study were to determine a how teachers define culture b what multicultural practices they endorse and c what schoollevel factors ie racialethnic demographics of the school and teacherlevel factors ie multicultural professional developmentcoursework grade level taught comfort level facilitating multicultural discussions and definitions of culture are associated with teachers endorsement of multicultural practices A sample ofelementary teachers grades kindergarten to fifth in three elementary schools completed a customdeveloped survey Findings indicated that teachers defined culture broadly with infrequent mention of specific identities and did not show strong endorsement of recommended multicultural practices Teachers definitions of culture and their school of employment were associated with teachers beliefs about practices Directions for future and implications for targeted professional development will be discussed PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedWithin the broad range of literature on the funds of knowledge approach several positive impacts have been documented In particular participating teachers have reported meaningful changes in their relationships with students families as a consequence of the home visits However few studies have assessed the limitations of the approach or areas for improvement Hence the aim of the study described here was to identify what teachers felt were the strengths and the weaknesses of the approach and to record their proposals for improvements The teachers involved had participated in all phases of the program from the initial training to the creation and implementation of educational activities based on the funds of knowledge identified from home visits The positive aspects identified include improved familyschool relationships a better understanding of student behavior and attitudes and the support of their colleagues and the University staff in the context of the study group created PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe Common European Framework of Reference for Languages CEFR began to have an influence on language teaching someyears ago However in spite of the title referring to learning teaching and assessment of languages the CEFR has had a far more pronounced impact on language testing than on any other aspect of language learningteaching In contrast this article focuses on the impact of the CEFR on teachers by analysing the beliefs about and perceptions of the CEFR held by a group of Spanish teachers about to take a Masters course module on the CEFR A item questionnaire was administered to these inservice teachers online to analyse their familiarity with the CEFR their perceptions of the impact of the CEFR and their knowledge of the contents of the CEFR The analysis shows that teachers degree of familiarity with the CEFR as a whole was superficial They reported a high degree of familiarity with levels of competences but limited knowledge of changes that the CEFR proposes despite the fact that they perceived the general impact of the CEFR on syllabi curricula and methods to be substantial There are clear implications for teacher education to ensure more thorough understanding of the CEFR PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe article focuses on the success of preschool teacher Hannah Krause a former equestrian athlete who left the US to teach in China It explores the kind of training Krause received before she became a champion in equestrian the challenges she went through to become an equestrian teacher in China and her belief that the country will become a better place to liveAn increase in the Dual Language Learner DLL population has led to a critical need for early childhood educators to understand how to best serve DLL children and their families This article describes a qualitative multiplecase study that investigated specific teaching practices for DLLs in six communitynominated exemplary preschool classrooms across three program types Head Start public PreK and private universityaffiliated preschool programs The aim of this study was to learn from exemplary teachers about their beliefs and practices for teaching young DLL children Data collection sources included interviews with teachers classroom observations video recordings and classroom artifacts Findings demonstrate that exemplary teachers hold assetoriented beliefs about bilingualism and diversity viewing DLL children and families as knowledgeable resources to the community With these beliefs as a foundation teachers enact a wide repertoire of practices tailored for DLL children including fostering relationships and belonging through embedding home languages and cultural practices in the classroom emphasizing guided play coconstructed curriculum and ongoing observational assessment and scaffolding and teaching the English language Implications for teaching and teacher education are discussed PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedAlthough a number of studies have examined EFL teachers beliefs of feedback on student writing few have investigated teachers feedback beliefs about student oral activities like oral presentations To fill this research gap this study explores three experienced EFL teachers beliefs about feedback on oral presentations in terms of the nature focus interpersonal functions strategies and source of teacher feedback Using semistructured interviews and classroom observations this study identified six major beliefs about feedback on student oral presentations and provided implications regarding how EFL teachers provide effective feedback to enhance student performance in oral presentationsThis qualitative study used a phenomenological methodology and an expectancyvalue framework to understand nontraditional preservice teachers motivations for choosing a teaching career Nontraditional preservice teachers in the current study are described as teacher candidates for whom teaching was not their first career choice Ten students enrolled in a Master of Arts in Teaching MAT program in the United States participated in indepth semistructured interviews about their decisions to become teachers Analyses revealed five thematic concepts that illustrated how participants described their entry to the teacher education program These themes related to participants ability beliefs and expectancies personal utility values intrinsic values social utility values and the costs associated with choosing a teaching career Implications for teacher education and mentoring programs are discussedThe aim of this study is to investigate the teachinglearning conceptions of preservice teachers who are studying in the science teaching and classroom teaching departments and also who will carry out science courses in the future The current study employing survey model was conducted on a total offourth year preservice teachersare preservice science teachers andare preservice classroom teachers in the fall term ofacademic year TeachingLearning Conception Scale was used as a data collection tool t was concluded that the female preservice teachers have higher level conception of constructivist approach than the male students and the preservice classroom teachers have higher level conception of constructivist approach than the preservice science teachersTeacher professional development PD has been claimed to be the foundation for transforming school culture Any PD activity with a human infrastructure that is composed of teachers researchers and policy makers who together form a professional learning community PLC situated in a local school must incorporate the teams appreciation of collective efficacy and sense of community in the learning environment A PLC must exemplify the concept of ongoing collaborative experiential learning through experimentation and reflection on emerging practices It is expected therefore that with everyones active involvement in the support structure teachers PD will be positively impacted and reflected in approaches to professional development Fundamental to the adult learning environment is the process of collaborative inquiry where participants critically reflect on their own experiences The process of collaborative inquiry encapsulates the notion that as teachers are regarded as lifelong learners they need to gather insights from their experiences with the support of their colleagues to ensure that their learning process contributes to the enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning outcomes Collaborative inquiry captures the idea of colearning PD where professional knowledge and skills are acquired and sustained in an authentic teaching environment that aims to foster sustainable changes in teaching practices Grounded in the principles of adult learning this article presents a methodological perspective on how educational institutions can form a professional learning community within the school context where problems from past experiences are critically examined and serve as a foundation to professionally reflect think and actThis crosssectional study examines associations between preservice teachers experiences in teacher education n their beliefs about culturally diverse students and their endorsed instructional practices within social reconstructionist and achievement goal theory frameworks Structural equation modeling confirmed significant associations between experiences in teacher education and discomfort with student diversity endorsement of mastery and performanceoriented practices and reluctance to adjust instruction to culturally diverse student needs The number of multicultural education courses completed negatively predicted preservice teachers stereotype beliefs and positively predicted mastery orientation Reluctance to accommodate to culturally diverse students educational needs mediated relations between stereotype beliefs and discomfort with student diversity with mastery and performanceoriented practices This demonstrates that general stereotype beliefs can inform proximal cultural intentions and instructional practicesWhile current reform efforts press for ambitious changes to teachers instructional practice teachers instructional beliefs are also consequential in such efforts as beliefs shape teachers instructional practice and their responses to instructional reforms This article examines the relationship between teachers instructional ties and their beliefs about mathematics instruction in one school district working to transform its approach to elementary mathematics education Quantitative results show that while teachers beliefs did not predict with whom they interacted about mathematics instruction teachers interactions with peers about mathematics instruction were associated with changes in their beliefs over time Qualitative analysis confirms and extends these findings revealing how systemlevel changes in the districts educational infrastructure facilitated change in teachers beliefs about mathematics instruction at scaleThe present study aims to explore the link between foreign language anxiety FLA and selfefficacy English selfperceived proficiency and three sociobiographical variables gender knowledge of a third language and experience abroad amongArabic university students learning English Data were collected using the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale Horwitz HorwitzCopeand an Arabic version of the Foreign Language SelfEfficacy Scale TorresTurnerThe findings revealed that this sample of Arab English as a foreign language EFL students experienced an average level of anxiety with female learners suffering more from anxiety than their male counterparts Regression analyses revealed that selfefficacy selfperceived proficiency in English and gender were predictors of FLA The results suggest that participants who were selfefficacious and felt more proficient in English were significantly less likely to suffer from FLA However even though knowledge of a third language and experience abroad were correlated with FLA they had no effect on participants anxietyThis study adds to the current literature on ongoing inhouse professional development for teachers by exploring how administrators other faculty and the Englishlanguage EFL teachers who participated in Cambridge University Presss Train the Trainer course TTT at King Abdulaziz University KAU Saudi Arabia judged the TTTs usefulness To determine whether to support the TTT in the future KAU wanted to identify how well its TTT graduates could provide professional development to their colleagues This studys aim is to discuss how positively those who were involved in the TTT particularly the administration the TTT graduate trainers themselves and the other teachers who attended the workshops presented by firstyear graduates of the ELIs TTT responded to the course The main question it addresses is how successful the implementation of such a TTT course can be at the English language institute of a Saudi university like at KAU so as to determine if the TTT should continue to be offered at KAU and more generally taking the example of the ELI at KAU if the TTT course should also be proposed at other English language institutes in Saudi Arabia This study employed a Likert scale survey semistructured interviews and openended questions with TTT participants administrators and other faculty to assess the TTTs initial value The main finding of this study is that so far the TTT course was perceived as beneficial However future analyses should evaluate the longerterm effects of the TTT on teaching approaches and student learningThis study aims to investigate the perspectives of nonnative English as a Foreign Language EFL teachers across mother tongue and gender and their male and female adult students regarding the use of Arabic in the EFL classrooms at the university level in Saudi Arabia The study specifically seeks to investigate the perspectives of nonnative Arab and nonArab EFL teachers as they working in the native Arab setting often resort to Arabic AlNofaieMachaalHowever there are glaring research gaps about nonnative EFL teachers and adult learners beliefs on the use of first language L in the classroom For this purpose the study used quantitative research design and administered two questionnaires one for the teachers and the other for the students Students questionnaire complemented that of the teachers Forty teachers and sixty students were selected based on stratified random sampling The findings of the study revealed that all camps of teachers Arab nonArab male female and students were in favour of judicious bilingual approach The study finds statistically significant difference between the beliefs of Arab and nonArab EFL teachers about the use of L The findings suggest that Arab EFL teachers use of Arabic is extensive while nonArab EFL teachers use of Arabic is welltimed The study suggested practical implications for the improvement of English Language Teaching ELT in Saudi Arabia by recommending planned occasional and judicious use of L while teaching EFL adult learnersThis present study probes the relationship between English as a Foreign Language EFL students language anxiety and their willingness to communicate The research questions are threefold a What are the types of anxiety experienced by the students b What is the anxiety level of them and c What is the correlation between foreign language anxiety FLA and the willingness to communicate WTC of the students Quantitative descriptive approach was employed and the data were collected fromparticipants in an English Department by making use of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale FLCAS and Likerttype WTC Scale Pearson Correlation test was run to provide answers of the research questions The results of this study indicated a strong positive correlation between learners foreign language classroom anxiety and their willingness to communicate Fear of negative evaluation test anxiety and communication apprehension were the students types of anxiety In addition students had high level of anxiety which in turn made them difficult in dealing with language learning process and tend to have low desire to speak Therefore this study tries to highlight whether anxiety is a significant barrier to WTC to determine the types and level of FLA as well as to provide suggestions to help minimize the anxietyThis research aims to explore Chinese overseas students at a Thai university with regard to their perceived benefits and limitations which are underpinned by the cultures of English language learning and teaching in China and in Thailand Drawing upon the notion of cultures of learning CortazziJinJinCortazzi this study investigates the students expectations beliefs and values in terms of effective teaching styles approaches and methods learning strategies and styles classroom interactions activities and the appropriate rapport between students and teacher Based on the students focusgroup data the findings reveal that the Chinese students compared and contrasted the benefits and limitations in terms of educational philosophies values policies and practices linguistic and cultural diversity and sociocultural contexts which impacted on their situated learning styles and strategies Cultures of learning were linguistically specific culturally sensitive contextually dependent dynamic agentive and nongeneralizable The pedagogical implications are related to Chinese students academic sociopsychological socioeconomic cultural and political dimensions This study addresses the students beliefs and practices in a language and culture immersion program at a Thai university which in retrospect promote culturally appropriate and sensitive teaching of English for comparative overseas education between China and ThailandThis study aims to explore the perceptions ofEnglish as a Foreign Language EFL teachers serving in public universities in Thailand regarding needs challenges and quality of teacher career development in their universities A questionnaire and an interview are employed to gather data According to the teacher development programs offered all universities served by the participants provide prospects for teachers to have further inservice education In relation to professional development nearly all participants point out a strong need for obtaining a higher degree as career advancement in their field and interestingly as a tool for salary increment Teacher collaboration and student learning also emerge as possible factors motivating teachers to strive for selfimprovement Although undertaking research is referred to as an important and for some a required element for English teaching jobs timeconsuming nature and a sophisticated process discourage its instigation Regarding views about quality of university teacher development most report being satisfied with the overall universities emphasis on improving English teaching and learning by accentuating teachers as a key However teachers lacking motivation to progress professionally due to excessive teaching workload and internal politics embedded in some universities can be reasons preventing teachers from securing educational growth Implications from the study shed light on the significance to support the quality of university teachers through furnishing sufficient opportunities of professional development and what Thai EFL university teachers aspire to accomplish most to develop themselves efficientlyThis study highlights the major emotional and psychological factors related to the medium of instruction use of First Language L in the classroom in the domain of bilingual education for adult Saudi English as foreign language EFL learners The primary area of emphasis is to consider whether the use of L in the class reduces the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety FLCA or it deprives the learners of the real and constant language inputs viz the words of the teacher in the target language Thus the main research question of the study is how the medium of instruction usemixing of Arabic or use of Englishonly approach impacts the FLCA Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety of Saudi adult learners The quantitative research tool of survey has been administered on the teachers and students on fivepoint Likertscale with the responses ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree There are twelve items in the survey and each item tends to explore different psychological dimension of the issueadult Saudi university students andEFL teachers have responded to these items The main finding of the study is that learners L speeds up the language learning process in a natural way if used occasionally and judiciously with the objective of keeping selfesteem and self image of the learners intact and bringing their FLCA down The research study not only brings to surface the current state of bilingual EFL education in Saudi context but also puts forth recommendations for learners teachers administrators and policy makers to strengthen English language teachinglearning in EFL perspective in the bilingual contextThis article details findings from research that involved a targeted literacy intervention developed for use with students with literacy learning difficulties LLD We discuss changes in the literacy skills of two groups of students with LLD over the course of the intervention that included explicit instruction in morphological awareness Thirtysix students with LLD from Yearstoparticipated in the two studies which were held over one school year Analyses indicated that in both studies students made significant gains in measures of literacy that included reading accuracy and reading comprehension These findings suggest that teachers should consider how a focus on morphology and its associated derivational complexities could benefit the literacy development of students with LLDThe purpose of the study is to determine the communicative approaches used by preservice teachers in science teaching For this purpose a week training program was developed and applied to raise the preservice teachers awareness of dialogic teaching and communicative approach Before and after this training program one lesson of each preservice teacher was videorecorded These videos were analyzed on the basis of four classes of communicative approach developed by Mortimer and ScottIn line with the purpose of the study the discourse analysis method was employed to determine the communicative approach used by the preservice teachers Moreover the preservice teachers were asked to watch their lessons videorecorded before and after the implementation of the training program and to write which communicative approach they used in these lessons and why they used this approach The findings of the current study revealed that the preservice teachers mostly preferred the authoritative approach before the training program yet after the training program besides the authoritative approach they started to use dialogic interactionbased communicative approach in their lessons Their reasons for using this communicative approach were also elicitedThe objective of the present study was to determine the views of preservice preschool teachers on Integrated Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM education and their tendencies about integrated STEM instruction The study group includedpreservice teachers The present study conducted as a single group research model with pretestposttest experimental method was completed inweeks Semistructured interview form developed by the authors and the Integrated STEM Instructional Tendencies Scale developed by Lin and Williamsadapted to Turkish by Hacmerolu and Bulutwere used as data collection instruments The qualitative data obtained are described with the content analysis methodology The quantitative data were analyzed with paired sample ttest After the implementation of the STEM education program it was determined that preservice preschool teachers had positive views on STEM education approach in general Furthermore according to results of the study that STEM education would encourage student to think transform theoretical knowledge into practice and to acquire the skills to obtain concrete products using the theoretical knowledge that they acquired in the class The majority of the participating preservice teachers indicated that undergraduate programs should include science technology engineering and mathematics courses teachers from different fields should collaborate and the teachers should receive STEM trainingThe important role that geometry plays in the mathematics curriculum has been extensively documented However the reduction of geometry in school mathematics and the focus on basic computation and procedures raises the question of the competencies students acquire and the classroom atmosphere in geometry lessons The goal of this multiple case study was to analyse four students conceptions of geometry and the emotional atmosphere in geometry lessons on an individual level Drawings were used as external representations of the students geometrical ideas and the emotional atmosphere The results show that the participants have a narrow understanding of geometry and that geometry teaching in their classrooms is reduced to frontal teaching with very limited communication Nevertheless the emotional atmosphere in these four cases could be described as positive or ambivalent Based on the data the results are discussed not only with regard to the utility of drawings as a research method to gain insights into students conceptions of geometry and emotional atmosphere in geometry lessons but also with regard to their theoretical and practical implicationsRecent research in English education has emphasised dialogically organised instruction to promote learning talk yet little is known about teachers perceptions of their efforts to teach dialogicallyThis study draws on videocued interviews to examine howsecondary preservice English teacher Emma experiences trying to teach dialogically andthe conflicting demands it elicits for her Findings indicate that she must navigate competing discourses including the curriculum the ideas of her mentor teacher her beliefs about dialogic teaching and her university schoolingEmmas accounts revealed that satisfying these at once was not achievable and that her endeavour to become a dialogic teacher was rife with conflictIt is important to identify and develop the professional qualifications of teachers who are one of the most decisive elements of contemporary education system Therefore it is important to determine the selfefficacy levels of teacher candidates in terms of being informed about their future pedagogical orientation For this reason the main purpose of this study is determine the extent to which extent teacher selfefficacy of classroom teacher candidates is predicted by motivational stability epistemological and pedagogical beliefs academic success and age variables In addition in this study it was also examined the participants selfefficacy levels and their selfefficacy changes according to gender and class level The data were collected through four different Likert type scales in this study in which a total ofclassroom teachers participated in a foundation university and which is based on a relational survey model Descriptive statistics ttest ANOVA and regression analyses were used to answer the research questions in this study As a result of analyzes made with SPSSpackage program it was found that participants teacher selfefficacy levels were above average significantly changed by class level and influenced by pedagogic beliefs and academic achievement In addition the variables of motivation epistemological and pedagogical beliefs academic achievement and age account forof the total variance on teacher selfefficacy The conclusions reached in this study both have confirmed the claims in the literature which contain theory based conceptualizations and have opened new ways to explore the relationship between pedagogical beliefs and teacher selfefficacy in teacher educationWhile researchers educators state and national organizations and policy makers are taking strides to help transform traditional mathematics classrooms into inquirybased classrooms they fail to address how to bridge the gap between creating discussions to developing mathematical discourse One key component for producing inquirybased classrooms is to have effective discussions SmithSteinHowever to have effective discussions social norms must be in place that promote active participation from students SherinTherefore the purpose of this paper is to synthesize educational research on social norms in the mathematics classroom to identify key components teacher educators can focus on to help teachers establish and implement social norms that promote sustainable inquirybased classrooms Results suggest social norms must be developed through collaboration of the teacher and students the classroom environment must be supportive of mathematical discussion and finally norms should be renegotiated to help change students ways of thinkingEffective teaching is considered to be one of the factors that can facilitate learner achievement The present study investigated the indicators that constituted good teaching from the perspective of highereducation students at Applied Linguistics departments Iran To do this following a substantial review of the literature the five major indicators with their subcomponents defining teaching effectiveness were identified viz PreparationOrganization Knowledge LearningThinking Enthusiasm and Delivery Next the questionnaire developed by Delaney et al was administered tohighereducation students who were selected through convenience sampling by emails The openended nature of the data needed a manual approach to the analysis and coding of the data Overallfinal characteristics were observed based on the analysis and were further discussed and elaborated onQuality teaching being a key factor in shaping students academic and personal growth has been at the centre of scientific debate for many years Sustainable professional development of novice teachers has recently been recognized worldwide as one of the key areas for improving the quality of teaching and learning in schools Given that the initial years on the job are generally characterised by novice teachers as the most challenging and intense in their career the following questions typically arise What can be done to sustain and facilitate teaching at the early developmental stages in teachers career What are the contextual factors and the prerequisites leading to the quality of teaching and learning The article presents the findings from a twoyear longitudinal qualitative study aimed to contribute to the research base for understanding this crucial stage More specifically the purpose of this study was to provide deeper understanding and insights into key factors influencing and shaping novice teachers early professional development and learning as well as their capacities to effectively adapt to their new roles and operate in complex and dynamically changing openended school environment The research is framed as a crosscase analysis ofcases of novice teachers working in public secondary schools The data were collected through multiple sources ie semistructured indepth interviews questionnaire and focus groups over a twoyear period spanning the participants first and second fulltime teaching years Substantial differences in experiences and beliefs among the novice teachers with varying levels of job satisfaction and professional support received were identified in the study The authors have also identified numerous patterns of novice teachers teaching practice closely associated with teachersconcerns and early professional experience interpretations which might result in substantial fluctuation in teaching quality and teachers career paths Implications for teacher education programs mentoring supervision teachers professional development and future research are discussedEven though its importance is underscored in many research pursuits attention to the affective domain in learning is often neglected at the expense of the cognitive development of students studying science in particular physics In this paper we propose a framework the pedagogical technological integrated medium PTIM founded on the TPACK model that builds on the existing premises of pedagogy content and technology to make space for the affective domain where these three premises intersect with each other We operationalize the PTIM framework through a multiloop model that explores the affective dimension as an overarching space for interaction among learners teachers and parents through a series of stages encompassing home tasks as well as classroom and outofschool activities Within the qualitative paradigm we substantiate from two case studies an exploratory and an evaluative one in two different schools that a succinct synchronisation of these various interactive elements promotes knowledge construction springing from the affective domain in terms of motivation interest and values and also from their interrelationshipsLanguage teaching materials play substantial roles in language classes around the world However it is the quality of materials along with the teachers use of them that determine the ultimate success of courses Teachers are hence encouraged to constantly evaluate and adapt the materials they use Few studies have systematically observed materials adaptation by teachers considering contextual factors affecting them though Contextual pressures can potentially provoke internal conflicts and in turn cause teachers severe emotional distress Yet teachers often manage to overcome such conflicts through selforganization and the construction of narratives of immunity The present study is hence designed to shed more light on how language teachers conceptualize and practice materials use Maintaining a casestudy research structure it draws on indepth data collected from four Iranian and four Japanese EFL teachers to make sense of how context alters practice The results of the analysis of classroom observation data indicate that while the Iranian teachers are more dependent on the published materials the Japanese teachers frequently adapt them Stimulated recall interviews also unravel qualitative intricacies regarding how they justify their materials and how they selforganize and construct narratives of immunity to shield themselves and their materials use against thirdparty criticism and blameDespite research on teacher written feedback on L students writing eg Ferris Pezone TadeTintiLeemuch needs to be known about the usability of teacher feedback ie whether teacher feedback carries potential for students to act upon it to improve their writing from teachers and students points of view From a formative perspective BrownGloverFernandezToro TrumanWalkerWalker this exploratory study investigatestwo Hong Kong college EFL teachers written feedback practices concerning the final products of their students academic writing in terms of the purpose of teacher feedback eg to point out a strength or weakness aspects of performance that it focused on eg content or skills development and the depth of feedback andteacher and student perceptions of the usability of teacher feedback as well as the relationship between the two The findings show that both teachers commented on the strengths and weaknesses of students writing provided feedback according to the assessment criteria and emphasized skills development more than content but they differed in terms of the depth of feedback Both convergence and divergence have been identified in teacher and student perceptions of the usability of teacher written feedback The pedagogical implications of the findings have also been discussedThis article discusses a survey study that adds to the literature on program evaluation Using a mixedmethods approach we examine feedback on learning and teaching experiences from instructors and graduating seniors in Spanish French and German major programs in a modern languages department The results are grouped into four major themes learners communication ability the four language skills learners connection to another culture learners expectations of their programs and learners preparation for their futures The alignment of student and teacher perceptions for each of these topics is discussed and the learner needs that emerged and the extent to which teachers expressed an awareness of these needs is examined Curricular improvements based on survey findings are also proposed which include incorporating more speaking and free studentstudent communication opportunities into the curriculum and establishing an activity where students can showcase evidence of oral skills upon graduating creating service learning opportunities and advertising them adequately offering phonetics and translation courses and increasing the focus on preparing students for realworld tasks related to the job market Because the surveys were constructed to address concerns that various foreign language programs may face this studys results may be useful to an array of language educatorsThis article examines four French immersion FI teachers perspectives on the relationship between language and culture and on their roles as intercultural mediators in New Brunswick NB Canadas only officially bilingual province Data were drawn from semistructured interviews with the teachers Couched in the broader framework of Canadas multicultural policy the cultural outcomes for NBs FI program underscore the importance of learning French in a multicultural and multilingual society Understanding the relationship between language and culture is part of this however the department explicitly states that it does not intend for immersion students to adopt Francophone culture This analysis shows that these teachers employ a variety of language ideologies all of which culminate in a languageascode approach devoid of culture and removed from its social contexts of use They do not consider deep cultural discussions to have a place in their classrooms although each teacher demonstrates some level of intercultural awareness regarding the languageculture dialectic in their private lives The works by Kohler Di Stefano and Kearney are employed to consider possible ways forward for teacher training on intercultural mediation in immersion classrooms and on curriculum development to target students intercultural competenceConsiderable resources are expended on the development of learner autonomy LA and in particular on the provision of selfaccess facilities as one of the most common ways in which institutions have tried to foster autonomy Whether the intended outcomes are achieved depends in large part on teachers agreement with and understanding of the rationale behind these efforts A mismatch between an institutional objective and a classroom implementation may for example negatively impact the student experience This project looks at teachers perspectives on LA and selfaccess language learning in a university setting where a selfaccess component was introduced as a compulsory element of students firstyear courses How do teachers conceptualise autonomous learning what importance do they assign to it and how do they attempt to foster autonomy in practice What role do they see for selfaccess learning in this In this project we used a mixedmethods approach and obtained questionnaire data fromteachers on an English as a Foreign Language programme at a university in Thailand as well as qualitative data from indepth interviews withteachers on their beliefs about autonomy and selfaccess The results show a complex interplay between teachers beliefs institutional constraints and classroom implementationThe next generation of professors will come from todays graduate students and postdoctoral fellows but we do not know much about their preparation to use researchvalidated teaching practices This study characterizes the teaching beliefs of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who represent future geoscience instructors thoughwe believe the implications go well beyond one discipline We analyzed results from more thanparticipants who completed the Beliefs about Reformed Teaching and Learning BARSTL survey and a subpopulation of sixty participants who responded to the Teacher Belief Interview TBI We compared teaching beliefs on the basis of several factors including gender teaching assistant experiences and participation in professional developmentProfessional development on inquirybased learning IBL generally draws heavily on the principle of providing instruction in line with what teachers are expected to do in their classroom So far however relatively little is known about how this impacts teachers educational beliefs even though these beliefs ultimately determine their classroom behavior The present study therefore investigates how immersion in inquirybased learning affects student teachers beliefs about knowledge goals in addition to their selfefficacy for inquiry In totalstudenthistory teachers participated in a h long inquiry activity designed within the WISE learning environment and completed a pre and posttest right before and after the intervention Multilevel analyses suggest that the intervention had a significant positive effect on the value that student teachers attributed to procedural knowledge goals or learning how historical knowledge is constructed and on student teachers selfefficacy for conducting inquiries Despite these general positive results however the results also show that the impact of the intervention differed significantly across students In particular it appears that immersion in IBL had little effect on a subgroup ofstudentteachers who held largely contentoriented beliefs Based on these findings the present study discusses a number of implications for professional development on IBLThe purpose of this study was to understand the use of interim assessment data to inform mathematics instruction A qualitative case study methodology was used to analyze the use of interim assessment data in a suburban elementary school Data sources included interviews with three teachers at varying levels of their profession and the principal observations of teachers working with assessment data in teams or as part of a professional development setting artifacts representing interim assessments supporting materials and analysis results The study explored the type of culture that was developed around data use the types of assessments that were used how the data were analyzed and teachers use of the data as a means to inform their instruction The results from this research will inform the work of teachers and administrators as they design systems to support students learningPrimary school students have difficulties with text comprehension and therefore support from teachers via proper language teaching strategies is needed The aim of the study was to determine the impact of language teaching strategies on students reading outcomes and reading interest In the current paper two reading outcomesvocabulary knowledge and understanding textand students interest in reading were considered In the studyEstonianspeaking primary school students and their native language teachers N fromschools participated The results revealed that interest in reading vocabulary knowledge and text comprehension were positively correlated Path analysis indicated that the strategy of developing reading interest had the strongest impact on both reading outcomes and students reading interest In addition the strategy of developing vocabulary had a positive effect on students vocabulary knowledge Surprisingly the strategies of teaching text comprehension and teaching grammar rules had negative effects on students reading outcomes and reading interest The findings emphasise the importance of proper usage of teaching strategies in primary school language lessonsThe main purpose of this research is to reveal the parents perceptions of the concept of mathematics through metaphors This research which is followed by the qualitative research paradigm is designed with a phenomenology design This study is consists ofparents whose children are primary school students in a public school in the Central Anatolia region during the spring semester of theacademic year All the parents who participated in the study were included in the study group on a voluntary basis The data were gathered with the Mathematicsbecausesentence directed to the parents The data were analyzed by content analysis technique According to the aim of the study the perceptions of parents emotions and thoughts evoking the mental concept of their parents were examined As a result of the research the metaphors are collected underconceptual categories life game airwater roadbridgekey novel writing functioning iron tree chainring a remaining song and beeEspecially life play and airwater metaphors came to the forefront among the perceptions of the mathematics concept of the parentsThis work aims to design implement and validate a model of incorporation of emerging technologies in the classroom using a designbased research methodology through two iterative cycles In the first iterative cycle this model was validated byexperts and implemented bypublic school teachers from BogotColombia The second cycle was validated and implemented byteachers A univariate statistical analysis was used to describe the samples in each cycle as well as content analysis to determine the different components of the model The model is composed of four conditioning factors motivation infrastructure ICT competencies and perceived usefulness four principles teacher reflection pedagogical flexibility dialogical communication and roles two recommendations temporality of the phases and peertopeer work and six phases initial reflection context analysis pedagogical foundation didactic application implementation and finally evaluationThe last few decades abound in studies concerned with what teachers students parents and other participants in the educational process believe about a wide variety of issues Most of these studies follow methodological procedures based on reports that people make about their own beliefs We argue that this strategy is seriously flawed under certain conditions that often obtain and therefore we should revise what we know so far about peoples beliefs We also suggest a more suitable alternative procedureSelfefficacy beliefs play a major role in determining teachers science teaching practices and have been a topic of great interest in the area of preservice science teacher education This qualitative study investigated factors that influenced preservice elementary teachers science teaching selfefficacy beliefs in a physical science content course The primary data sources included Science Teaching Efficacy Belief InstrumentB STEBIB responses two semistructured interviews classroom observations and artifacts Analysis of STEBIB data was used to selectparticipants with varying levels of selfefficacy beliefs low medium and high Four categories representing courserelated factors contributing towards participants science teaching selfefficacy beliefs were foundenhanced science conceptual understandingsactive learning experiencesteaching strategies andinstructor as a role model While some course elements such as handson learning experiences and inquirybased teaching strategies seemed to impact all groups positively the lowgroup participants were particularly benefited from the ways in which science concepts were presented and the pace at which learning progressed One implication from this study is that science educators could include elements within science content courses to potentially support preservice teachers with varied initial levels of science teaching selfefficacyPlaceBased education PBE is gaining rapid recognition across the United States The authors of this article contend that there is an imperative need to restructure and reconceptualize teacher education such that it allows for a significant shift in thinking and practice around learning teaching and community They advocate that the PBE model is ideally suited to this end Among the many strengths of PBE is the flexibility inherent in the model such that it can and must be adapted to authentically represent individual communities In their work with PBE the authors have identified three core pedagogical anchors inquirybased instruction connection to place and informed civicengagement that uniquely represent the transformative work they are doing in teacher education Along with examples and explanation of the three pedagogical anchors the article also provides a brief discussion of the creation of the PBE teacher preparation pathway at Eastern Michigan UniversityThis article presents a description of the Alliance for Catholic Educations ACEs approach to and experience of implementing a pilot blended learning and school improvement initiative in five Catholic schools in three US archdioceses Program evaluation data is summarized including results of teacher surveys measuring increases in perceptions of knowledge of and attitudes toward components of the model The project description and findings offer a model for other Catholic schools considering introducing blended learning approaches as part of school improvement effortsThe role that spirituality plays in the healthy development of children can be a central part of the way in which they are socialized There has been very little systemic research which has explored the strengths of African American children their families and communities including the ways in which the African American community socializes resilience Instead research focuses on the social problems that African Americans are experiencing such as poverty educational underachievement teenage pregnancy drug use and crime Spirituality has been characterized as being a key factor in how African Americans cope with social problems and stressful events Additionally the paper will discuss implications for social work practiceThis study examined the reliability and validity of the Classroom Assessment Scoring SystemSecondary CLASSS in Finnish classrooms Trained observers coded classroom interactions based on video recordings ofGradeclassroomscycles Concurrent associations were investigated with respect to teacher selfratings eg efficacy beliefs and teachingrelated stress Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the hypothesized threefactor structure of the original CLASSS Emotional Support Organizational Support and Instructional Support with some modifications provided a better fit for the data compared with one and twofactor structures Structural validity was demonstrated by mostly high factor loadings Except for two interrater intraclass correlations all item scale and interrater reliabilities were either acceptable or good The study found some evidence for concurrent associations between the three CLASSS factors and teacher selfratings The results provide evidence of the applicability of the CLASSS instrument in educational contexts Finland outside the United StatesThis study sets out to investigate the attitude KS pupils have towards mathematics and the factors that influence this attitude A case study approach was used as the pupils were a unit of the school under study and a survey method was chosen to provide scope to the study Purposeful sampling was employed for the selection ofpupils from yearsandwho were from target achiever and non target achiever groups Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory Tapiawas administered to the participants to measure their attitude towards mathematics Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS versionThe result for the first hypothesis indicated that there is a significant difference on the variable of mathematics attitude of yearandtarget achievers and non target achievers pupils t dfpand for the second hypothesis the difference in the variety of attitudes is statistically significant in the pupuls from both groups t dfpThe results of the research will enable teachers to understand the factors that effect attitude of pupils towards mathematics at secondary level and direct head teachers to establish effective teacher training and support system to help pupils to develop an interest in mathematicsBackground Children living in urban areas often have limited opportunities to experience informal science environments As a result some do not have a deep understanding of the environment natural resources ecosystems and the ways human activities affect nature Purpose This article examines how experiential science education supported urban childrens science knowledge and engagement through cultural relevance and ecojustice during a week summer camp MethodologyApproach Third through sixthgrade children from African American and Latinx urban communities in Colorado participated in a weeklong program using experiential learning opportunities including environmental and climate change lessons activities at a local communitybased site and field trips to nature and sciencethemed sites Pre and posttests focus group interviews journals and student work samples were analyzed FindingsConclusions Childrens science content knowledge as well as their engagement in science lessons and field trips were positively influenced during the study Implications This study provides a template for establishing culturally relevant experiential learning opportunities to engage underrepresented children in scienceThis article discusses some of the experiences gained from three students studying ethics in integrated and collaborative RE lessons The data comes from a teaching experiment devised especially for research purposes In this experiment students from Lutheran Greek Orthodox secular humanist backgrounds studied ethicsrelated contents together The interview data and data from their diaries were analysed with qualitative inductive content analysis The results show how the emphasis on the reflection of the students differs by describing three cases one from each background In practice one of the students emphasised the importance of teacher collaboration in making teaching significant another student considered that it was the liferelated topics that made teaching significant The third student emphasised that facilitating dialogue makes teaching significantStudies related to the effectiveness of policy making have been focused on the concerns of domain experts not stakeholders The purpose of this study was to construct an acceptance model of educational policy to explore competency standards integration and technicalvocational education and teaching Based on the perspectives of professors from science and technology universities this study examined the correlations among teaching progressive beliefs perceived ease of policy understanding and application perceived value to students and attitudes toward policy implementation Quantitative data fromparticipants were collected for confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling The results revealed that teaching progressive beliefs was positively related to perceived ease of policy understanding and application to teaching settings perceived ease of policy understanding and application were positively associated with value to students and value to students was positively correlated with attitude toward policy implementation In addition teaching progressive beliefs positively predicted the implementation attitude that was mediated by the perceived value of policies however perceived ease of policy understanding and application were essential in explaining the expectancyvalue research model This study suggested that formalization of the policy acceptance model can be applied to explore other policies related to education and policy making for understanding stakeholders attitudes toward the implementation of new policiesSystematic studies on the effectiveness of inservice teacher professional development PD are important for science education research and practice Previous studies have mostly focused on certain outcomes of PD for example the effectiveness of PD for improving teachers knowledge or students learning outcomes This study however explores multiple outcomes of PD from teachers change in knowledge and practice and how teacher change influences students beliefs and ultimately their understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts The sample includedstudents fromclassrooms withinelementarymiddle schools The results showed that teacher attendance in professional learning communities and interdisciplinary science research related positively to teachers scores on a pedagogical content knowledge test Students whose teachers had more thanPD hours in the past academic year performed significantly better on an interdisciplinary science test Followup analyses suggested that student understanding of the nature of science possibly mediates the positive effect between PD hours and student understanding of interdisciplinary science conceptsThe purpose of the present study is to determine teachers professional competences in learning to be and provide practical solutions for its realization The research employed a mixedmethods sequential explanatory design and was conducted through two qualitative and quantitative methods The population of the qualitative research consisted of educational experts among whomparticipants were selected through the purposive sampling technique after conducting interviews and data saturation The population of the quantitative research included high school teachers in districtsandof Isfahan among whomholding MA MSc and PhD degrees were selected via purposive sampling technique In the qualitative section the data collection instrument was semistructured interview and in the quantitative section a subscale researchermade Teacher Professional Competences Questionnaire Findings of the qualitative section were categorized into teachers cognitive competences educational and managerial skills and scientific attitudinal skill behavioral and general competences From teachers viewpoints the most important competences in learning to be was their ability to develop selfesteem and selfconfidence in students ability to increase personal skills such as selfawareness and selfbelief in students and their ability to guide students to determine the valuable goals for their lives There was a consensus among views of experts and teachers about professional competences There were no differences in the teachers opinions regarding the demographic characteristics of professional competences Practical solutions of this learning approach were categorized by educational experts into solutions related to teacher education strategies educationaltraining modalities and the involvement of effective factorsThis quantitative study utilizedP students learning outcomes as a result of unit instructions that preservice teachers gave to P students in the field The study investigated the difference in P student learning outcomes after a unit instruction by three preservice teaching practicum course tiers considering socioeconomic statuses student grade levels and subject areas of the content taught by the preservice teacher Using normalized gain scores we used a t test and regression analysis to analyze the data Based on the findings recommendations for preservice teacher education include three items a to provide differentiated supervision based on preservice teachers experiences and needs b to require a proportionate and incremental assignment responding to the amount of preservice teachers experiences and hours in the classroom and c to incorporate coteaching opportunities to facilitate peer learning and support in early field experiencesThis research examines the design and delivery of a new Foundations of University Teaching Practice FUTP program delivered through asynchronous online modules The freedom to choose defines the new momentum of openness in distance and open learning University teaching staff expect quality resources to support their professional development within the reality of limited time for learning and a desire for increased accessibility Openness and increased access bring both opportunities and challenges This paper uses mixed methods to examine the FUTP from the perspectives of both the designers and the academic staff who participated in the program Using personal reflections focus groups a survey and interviews we explore those opportunities and challenges within the context of the design and delivery of the program and report on the findings Our research confirmed the value of openness and increased access to professional learning in higher educationThe purpose of the present study is to investigate school administrators character education efficacy beliefs according to the variables which are gender age professional and administrative experience marital status the graduated faculty level of graduation and level of the school administered The research was conducted according to the survey model of quantitative research methods The population of the study constitutes of administrators who work in public schools in stanbulPendik District in the academic year of administrators were included in the study chosen

WhitneyU and Kruskal WallisH tests from nonparametric analysis techniques It was concluded that school administrators character education efficacy beliefs did not show a significant difference in terms of gender age professional and administrative seniority marital status the graduated faculty administrative position level of graduation and level of the school administered Conducting similar studies with different sample groups and variables is expected to contribute to the field of character educationChildren have a natural curiosity about sound This is particularly evident in the context of musical play The potential of play for music learning may be overshadowed by a teacherled and performancefocused approach to music education rather than an organic selfinitiated approach By bringing together the childs natural curiosity about sound a rich music environment and effective teacher guidance the stage is set for building a strong foundation of musical understandings during a childs first five years a critical period of the childs musical development This article draws attention to and provides examples of ways that musical play can be fostered and enacted in the New Zealand early childhood context The unique holistic nature of the New Zealand early childhood curriculum Te Whriki does not address music explicitly Rather aspects of music pedagogies are embedded throughout the document within a complex weaving together of principles strands and goalsA number of studies examined nonroutine questions in mathematics learning in recent years The purpose of this study is to examine the studies on nonroutine problems in the national and international literature In doing so the study designs methods and results were described Among the descriptive analysis techniques document analysis was used in the study A total ofdescriptive and experimental studies on nonroutine problems were compiled using various databases Four research questions guided the analysis of the studies One of the main findings was that the participants in the studies were more successful in solving nonroutine questions compared to routine questions Moreover the participants were not successful in utilizing more than one solutions for nonroutine questions It is believed that proving students with problem solving and metacognitive learning strategies would increase their achievement in nonroutine problems Conducting further studies on the effects of different instructional approaches and techniques on nonroutine problem solving is recommendedThe aim of this study is to examine the changes in course planning and the practice processes of prospective science teachers following the inservice trainings they received about openended inquirybased teaching approach OEIBTA With this aim preexperimental design with one group posttest was employed This study was conducted withprospective science teachers in a public university in Turkey The Course Plan Assessment Rubric and Course Observation Form were developed as data collection instruments for gathering information regarding the planning and practices of the prospective science teachers Thus study included two phases the Planning Phase in which the prospective teachers learn how to plan with the teaching approach and the Practice Phase in which the prospective teachers apply what they plan Both phases lasted about one term The results showed that all participant prospective teachers showed improvements in the planning phase of the OEIBTA training program which had been delivered to them graduallyThis study aimed to determine the epistemological beliefs ofteacher candidates studying at the Education Faculty Secondary Grade Science and Mathematics Education departments and the teacher candidates attending the Primary Grade Mathematics and Science Education departments and to examine whether these epistemological beliefs differ on the basis of gender learning style academic average class level and department The study made use of the Epistemological Beliefs Inventory and the Kolb Learning Styles Questionnaire According to the analysis results there were differences seen in dependent variables based on gender Also there was a negative relationship found between the learning styles and epistemological beliefs The analysis results suggest that the teacher candidates mostly possess a strong belief that learning is dependent on effort and that they possess a weak belief that there is only one truth that epistemological beliefs of the candidates show meaningful differences on the basis of each dimension and class levels and that females possess more developed beliefs than malesThe purpose of this research is to determine whether there is a meaningful relationship between secondary school students attitude and perception levels of selfefficacy oriented by researchinquiry and as well whether students attitude and selfefficacy levels differ according to grade and gender The working group of the study consist ofsecondary school students The descriptive model of one of the quantitative research methods was used in this research The data of the study was collected with Perception Scale of SelfEfficacy Oriented by ResearchInquiry and Attitude Scale Oriented by ResearchInquiry Percentages mean Anova Schieffe and t tests have been benefited in this study

CFA were applied to the collected data Based on these analyses it was found that the adapted scale into Turkish consisted ofitems which were and gathered under four factors The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the overall scale wasTestretest correlation coefficient was found as rThese values indicate that the questionnaire is highly reliable The scale is found to be valid and reliable and appropriate to use in Turkish cultureStudents associating their knowledge with daily life demonstrates great significance in terms of understanding the importance of topics they learn in school as well as knowing where and how they are used in their daily life In this context teachers who will reflect these relationships in learning environments must have sufficient knowledge and experience In this research it was aimed to investigate the effects of teaching applications with real life content on the levels of preservice teachers abilities to associate daily life with astronomy and electrical learning topics The sample consisted of totallyfourth class students who were at the department of Science Teaching in the Faculty of Education In the research astronomy and electrical learning topics were chosen and activities based on real life problems in these were applied The data gathered were based on the effects of these activities The research was conducted following an experimental design and data were collected applying the prepost test pattern The data were collected through openended questionnaires related to the use of learning topics in daily life As a result it was found that the levels of associating the learning topics with daily life were nearly doubled in the field of electrical and astronomy learning topicsIn the research it is aimed to investigate the classroom environment perceptions of the third and fourth graders in terms of some variables Accordingly What is happening in this class scale has been adapted into Turkish and validity and reliability studies have been conducted as well Then the scale was administered tostudents at the third and the fourth grades of primary school in the fall semester of theacademic years The data was analyzed terms of gender class level and sociocultural status of the school The findings indicate that the students perceptions of classroom environment in the factors of Student Cohesiveness Teacher Support Participation Investigation Task Orientation Cooperation and Equity are Always Additionally there is a significant difference between students classroom environment perceptions in favour for girls According to grades there is a significant difference between students classroom environment perceptions in favour of the third grade students Based on the school sociocultural status there is a significant difference between students classroom environment perceptions towards very goodThe theoretical fivefactor model for the item Beliefs About Language Learning Inventory BALLI has rarely been examined empirically despite its wide use to investigate language learning beliefs This study examined the BALLIs dimensional structure with a sample of undergraduate students at a Thai university N malefemaleage mean years taking an elementarylevel Japanese language course Confirmatory factor analysis by Mplus did not support Horwitzs theoretical model While a fivefactor model was identified from exploratory factor analysis the combined items within each dimension were different from Horwitzs model Thus the original fivefactor BALLI model was only partially supported We were able to affirm the core aspects of language learning beliefs composed of eight BALLI items and we offer a roadmap to develop the modelObjective A qualitative study was conducted to explore the perception of healthcare professional students about mobile learning acceptance Method The study was performed using a conventional content analysis method The subjects were the students of medical sciences in Iran University of Medical Science Sampling was based on a purposeful sampling method Twentythree students took part in semistructured interviews until data saturation was reached Results The main theme was the paradox of acceptance and rejection with three categoriesperceived attraction subcategories learning with the excitement of entertainment the attraction of multimedia learning environment and enthusiasm for electronic learningperceived ease subcategories easy access to information anytime and anywhere and easy and effortless use andperceived conflict subcategories teachers contradictory behavioral patterns contradiction about value of online information friends contradictory behavioral patterns and digital gap between generations in family Conclusion The three categories found in the study placed the students in a dilemma of using or not using mobile learning They had doubts about accepting mobile technology as a legitimate educational tool Taking these factors into account and managing them can pave the way for mobile learning in the studentsThe aim of this study is to reveal contributions of the differentiated instruction implemented in the primary school th grade science course into science literacy levels of the students The case study method among qualitative research methods were used in the study The research was carried out in the second term of academic year The study group consisted of the th grade students n aged studying in the Kozabirlik Primary State School in Bilecik city center in Turkey Interviews teachers and students observations and student diary forms were administrated as data collection tools in the study The content analysis method was implemented in the analysis of the obtained data It was concluded from the findings that the differentiated instruction improved involvements of the students with the sciencetechnologysociety and the environment and developed their scientific process skills and thus contributed to the science literacy levels of the studentsThis study examined Syrian refugee English as a Foreign Language EFL learners perceptions regarding learner autonomy as well as their readiness for autonomy in English language learning It also investigated the effects of grade and gender on learners perceptions A mixedmethod research design was utilized and findings indicated that neither grade nor gender had caused statistically significant differences in terms of Syrian refugees perceptions of learner autonomy in language learning nevertheless both had caused statistically significant differences in terms of subscales While thegraders in this study perceived themselves as being more autonomous in terms of experience in language learning the female students seemed more autonomous in terms of their perceptions of the role of teachers and feedback Additionally although the learners perceptions regarding autonomy were slightly lower than their readiness for autonomy there was a statistically significant relationship between their perceptions of learner autonomy and their readiness for autonomy in language learning When their perceptions about learner autonomy increased their readiness for autonomy also increasedThe article offers authors comment of Agran et al s commentary which focuses on improving life of people who have severe disabilities Topics

community settings and civic responsibilities of the societyThis qualitative study focused on the life histories of four female AfricanAmerican middle level teachers The findings illuminate how culturally responsive caring can and should be foundational to successful teaching that does not discriminate but instead uplifts every student and assures them that teachers will seek to know understand teach and not degrade them Elements of this caring framework include serving as students otherparents or fictive kin taking time to know students without judgment appreciating the knowledge in students communities believing in students brilliance and holding them accountable in warm yet demanding ways teaching racial history and teaching students to speak back to negative profiles that define them and never sugarcoating injustices but teaching for successThis special issue of School Psychology Review entitled Closing in on Discipline Disproportionality examined promising approaches and critical challenges to closing racial and ethnic gaps in schools use of exclusionary and punitive discipline practices In this introductory article we briefly review the rationale and urgency for a focus on disproportionality in discipline and highlight some of the most salient findings from the five empirical studies in this special issue We identify directions for the field going forward with particular attention to measurement dilemmas and structural factors that shape differential disciplinary outcomes Consistent with the National Association of School Psychologists position statement we emphasize the need to build the science of discipline disparities intervention through more systematic empirical research Taken together these new directions are intended to catalyze scientific rigor in the next generation of evidencebased interventions to close the discipline gapThis article presents findings from a randomized controlled trial RCT testing the impact of a novel coaching approach utilized as one element of the Double Check cultural responsivity and student engagement model The RCT includedelementary and middle school teachers randomized to receive coaching or serve as comparisons all participating teachers were exposed to schoolwide professional development activities Prepost nonexperimental comparisons indicated improvements in selfreported culturally responsive behavior management and selfefficacy for teachers in both conditions following professional development exposure With regard to the experimental findings trained observers recorded significantly more proactive behavior management and anticipation of student problems by teachers higher student cooperation less student noncooperation and fewer disruptive behaviors in classrooms led by coached teachers relative to comparison teachers Taken together the findings suggest the potential promise of coaching combined with schoolwide professional development for improving classroom management practices and possibly reducing office discipline referrals among Black studentsThe discipline gap between White students and African American students has increased demand for teacher training in culturally responsive and behavior management practices Extant research however is inconclusive about how culturally responsive teaching practices relate to student behavior or how to assess using such practices in the classroom Identifying proactive behavior management and culturally responsive teaching practices that are associated with positive student behavior may inform teacher training and bolster efforts to reduce disparities in behavioral and academic performance The current study examined the association between student behaviors and the observed use of and teacher selfreported efficacy in using culturally responsive teaching and proactive behavior management practices Data were collected fromteachers inschools Structural equation modeling indicated a statistically significant association between observations of culturally responsive teaching and proactive behavior management practices with observed positive student behaviors in classrooms Implications for measurement and practice are discussedThe article discusses the importance of evaluation of a school library by the American Association of School Librarians for implementing continuous program intended to improve educational standards Topics discussed include steps in evaluating school libraries need for teacher librarian to take a leadership role in the state evaluation process to ensure that the school library aligns with state initiatives in terms of competencies and evolution of national standards on school librarianThis qualitative study examined preservice teachers PSTs ideas and beliefs regarding the use of rap for instructional purposes in P classrooms and the ways in which they proposed to use rap in the teaching of middle and high school social studies Participants included the instructor of a social studies methods course and thirteen PSTs enrolled in the course The findings suggest that PSTs view rap as a phenomenon that must be approached in a careful manner and that is best suited to content areas other than social studies The findings also suggest that PSTs proposed uses of rap represent P education as an uncritical teachercentric endeavor which serves to perpetuate the status quoFor decades the term learner autonomy has been the focus of many studies in the field of education and language learning This study addresses teachers perspectives of learner autonomy in Saudi Arabia It examines whether teachers have the knowledge to encourage and foster learnerautonomy This study also seeks to explore the challenges English language teachers face in the process of implementing learner autonomy into their EFL classrooms The investigation was conducted using a sample ofEnglish language teachers teaching Saudi students at King AbdulAziz University Data was collected using a item questionnaire The study was a mixed research method Collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis The findings revealed that teachers believe that Saudi learners in the current situation are nonautonomous learners they lack the knowledge and the training to apply it Findings also revealed that teachers are familiar with the learnerautonomy yet they stated that they need proper training and professional development to help encourage learner autonomy It is an attempt to contribute to the literature underlying learner autonomy in the field of language learning in the Saudi context Also it suggests further research to help better comprehend the value of teachers role in the process of autonomous language learning for learnersIdentity is a comprehensive and complicated concept in the process of language teaching and learning The present study attempted to examine the effect of teachers talk and identity in the classroom context on EFL learners achievements The Conversation Analysis CA approach was applied to gather and analyze naturallyoccurring spoken interaction The teachers interactions with their learners were audiorecorded and analyzed in terms of the IRF cycle InitiationResponseFeedback turntaking and renovate The findings indicated that the plenty of interaction was assembled and retained through dissymmetrical and privileged relations The teacher identified and regulated most of the social actions that happened in the classroom context most of which were also completely designed on a goaloriented basis It was concluded that it is time to reassert the role of teacher as a dominant individual who controls learning inside and outside the classroom educators and teachers should develop an instructional design that focuses on incorporating active learning and studentcentered pedagogy into the traditional lecturebased coursesNumerous initiatives are carried out across the world to support science teaching in early childhood education However professional development research shows that in order for teaching interventions to bring about successful changes in practice it is key that teachers beliefs confidence and knowledge change As a complement to studies showing how teachers change this article examines why teachers adopt a pedagogical idea for teaching science in preschool Drawing on Clarke and Hollingsworths model for teacher professional growth the article analyses interviews with teachers that have implemented and developed a pedagogical idea for teaching science in preschool The results indicate that teachers adopt the pedagogical idea because it helps them to discern and build on science content in everyday practice which they prefer to their previous way of teaching science through occasional experiments Further the results show that teachers balance several external influences on what is good preschool pedagogy The particular pedagogical idea eases that balancing act since it aligns with and helps teachers to make meaning of many of these influences PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights

with variation in the rigor of the writing tasks teachers assign Previous research suggests that teachers beliefs about instruction significantly contribute to their decisionmaking therefore teachers conception of textbased writing likely influences the tasks they assign Yet teachers conceptions of textbased writing have yet to be charted In the present study through qualitative analysis of interviews we identified three such conceptions among th and th grade teachers n textbased writing as application of reading skills and strategies nas inquiry into text ideas nand a mixed conception as both skillsandstrategiesbased and affective response tangential to text nAnalysis of assigned textbased writing tasks n showed that regardless of their conception all teachers assigned tasks reflecting the assessment and accountability demands of their policy context Beyond this teachers assigned tasks were consistent with their conception Teachers who held the first conception assigned predominantly tasks focused on demonstrating reading skills The second group of teachers assigned a greater proportion of tasks guiding students to interpret or analyze big ideas than did other teachers Finally teachers holding mixed conceptions assigned routine skillsbased tasks and personal or creative writing in nearequal proportions We argue that teachers conceptions of textbased writing provide an important leverage point for supporting textbased writing instruction PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedSeveral studies showed that mental wellbeing varies based on employment status A comprehensive assessment of wellbeing covering both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects has been considered essential to capture an individuals positive mental health Aims Based on the classification proposed in the Mental Health Continuum model by Keyesaims were to estimate teachers prevalence of mental health and to examine the associations between mental health and respectively burnout depression teacher selfefficacy teacher collective efficacy and job satisfaction taking into account the job statushigh school teachers completed a selfreport questionnaire Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational analyses Findings showed thatof participants were flourishingwere moderately mentally healthy andwere languishing The flourishing group reported lower prevalence of depression and burnout and higher levels of job satisfaction and efficacy beliefs than the other two groups Significant differences between the permanent and temporary teachers emerged Interventions to improve teachers wellbeing should take into account factors as teachers selfefficacy collective efficacy as well as teachers perception of job satisfaction and the adverse impact that the condition of temporary teacher could have on work PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedboldBackground boldSchistosomiasis a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites that infest open water

kindergartens have become more multicultural the need for cultivating teachers capable of operating in an ever diversified and global world is highlighted as an important educational strategy within teacher education The purpose of the specific intercultural program in kindergarten teacher education discussed in this article refers to competences needed as a professional teacher in a multicultural kindergarten Teachers often have various assumptions and beliefs taken for granted Therefore reflexivity appears in intercultural education as a crucial asset However the article argues that the notion of selfcontemplation and selfreflection that can give the subject freedom as a thinking being needs to be challenged Questioning beliefs and assumptions includes an examination of ones emotional experiences values and perspectives This examination can threaten ones core beliefs and create powerful feelings such as anger shame or resentment Introducing the concept of disorienting dilemmas the article problematizes the rationalist intellectual orientation in teacher education and discusses the need to focus on intercultural experiences as sensuous intellectual and affective The article illustrates some disorienting dilemmas with narratives from students who have attended the program Finally the article considers the conditions and pedagogical means that might support a more holistic approach to learning in intercultural experiences PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedSeveral large scale assessments include student teacher and school background questionnaires Results from such questionnaires can be reported for each item separately or as indices based on aggregation of multiple items into a scale Interpreting scale scores is not always an easy task though In disseminating results of achievement tests one solution to this conundrum is to identify cut scores on the reporting scale in order to divide it into achievement levels that correspond to distinct knowledge and skill profiles This allows for the reporting of the percentage of students at each achievement level in addition to average scale scores Dividing a scale into meaningful segments can and perhaps should be done to enrich interpretability of scales based on questionnaire items as well This article illustrates an approach based on an application of Item Response Theory IRT to accomplish this The application is demonstrated with a polytomous rating scale instrument designed to measure students sense of school belongingBackground Assessment policies and practices are key to the success of curriculum innovations Therefore largescale ELT innovations always include changes in assessment too Thinking that Iranian students were not enabled to communicate in English after six years of English education in public schools educational policy makers have recently embarked on a new curriculum that is thought to be a departure from traditional reading and grammar approach towards a communicative one This study investigated the impact of a recent language assessment reform LAR on Iranian English teachers assessment practicesMethods To this end four teachers participated in a focused group interview FGI session Teachermade tests were also collected and scrutinized Both FGI and test data were content analyzed and the recurring themes were derivedResults It was revealed that managerial institutional and individual barriers stand in the way of the reform First the managerial technocratic approach to reform implementation has caused teachers not to take ownership of the reform Secondly at the institutional level two obstacles were identified in the way of reform inadequate resources within schools and the accountability demands that foster grade inflation Finally regarding professional competencies teachers appeared to be largely unprepared to conduct language assessments consistent with the LAR demands In particular they seemed to have difficulties with the contents of their assessments with the reasons for doing assessments and with adjusting their assessments in keeping with LAR communicative aspirationsConclusions To remedy the situation action should be taken to convince teachers to buy into the reform and to create opportunities for teachers to become adequately literate in language assessmentData fromteachers who participated in the National Center for Research on Early Childhood Education study were used to examine the implications of classroom age diversity in preschool programs for teacher interactions with students in areas of instructional and emotional support and classroom organization Teachers in early childhood classrooms with greater age diversity within a school year and who experienced an increase in age diversity across years exhibited less optimal teacherchild interactions The negative effects of age diversity for teacherchild interactions were only noticeable among teachers with fewer years of education and experience and among teachers whose views of children were less childcentered When taken together results indicate that closer attention should be paid to the consequences of classroom age diversity in preschool and that a multiyear perspective on teachers classroom experiences would allow for a more nuanced understanding of the quality of teacherchild interactions PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThis study used a staticgroup pretestposttest design to investigate how the socialemotional skill development ofTurkish children aged

stimulating and maximise opportunities for enhancing and extending each childs learning and development Australian Childrens Education and Care Quality Authority ACECQApAdditionally articleof the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child UNCRC advises that it is a childs right to contribute and their opinions need to be considered in decisions that affect them United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEFNonetheless limitations appear to exist in supporting educators decisions and provisions in the environment and use of the outdoor learning spaces that contrast with the documents that underpin educator practice This literature review examines the tensions between the ideal and the reality of childrens and educators decision making in outdoor learning spaces It shows that strong policy alone is not sufficient unless underpinned by an environment in which educators are able to make decisions without fear of litigation and childrens perspectives are heard respected and enactedThe article focuses on the significant impact of teachers on students which is not measured with test scores It expresses the view that teachers influence their students beliefs about themselves as learners noting key beliefs that contribute to the tendency of the students to persevere in the classroom Research on the significance of a growth mindset and on academic perseverance which demonstrate the importance of noncognitive skills is notedThe article discusses the services given by school psychologists to Latino immigrant students who are experiencing trauma in the US

of the important connection between positive emotional climate and academic successThe purpose of this study was to identify beginner teachers sources of knowledge for teaching literature in the English Second Language ESL classroom A review of the literature on ESL teachers knowledge indicated a paucity of studies that focus specifically on teaching knowledge for Literature as a standalone subject in ESL In addition ESL teacher training in most countries seemingly focuses on preparing preservice teachers for language teaching rather than literature To identify the sources of teaching knowledge for Literature teachers this study adopted an interpretivist epistemological worldview and used a qualitative single case study design Data were collected using nonparticipant observations and semistructured interviews from four purposively selected Literature in English beginner teachers Quality and ethical considerations were upheld in this study using a number of strategies Inductive thematic analysis was used for data analysis The analysis resulted in three sources of ESL Literature teaching namely theory of language education the nature of the subject and problematic areas in Literature teaching The findings may be of benefit to ESL teacher preparation programmes which could use them to provide preservice teachers with multiple contexts as sources of teaching knowledgePurpose Mental health professionals personal values have a critical role in providing efficient services to culturally diverse clients being social advocates and promoting social justice In the present study mental health professionals in Turkey were assumed to be grouped under three categories the ones who are sensitive who are rigid and who are apathetic based on their Belief in a Just World moral identity openmindedness and social dominance orientation scores The study aimed to examine the differences among these three groups of mental health professionals in Turkey in relation to social justice Methods A total ofmental health professionals participated in the study The Social Justice Scale Moral Identity Scale OpenMindedness Scale Social Dominance Scale and Belief in a Just World Scale were used to collect data and cluster analysis was performed to analyze the data Findings The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between three categories regarding social justice scores Results pointed out that sensitive Turkish mental health professionals were more to prone to social justice than the other groups Implications for Research and Practice According to the results there is a potential risk that there might be cultural groups outside of the boundaries of these mental health professionals scope of justice In order to prevent these risks some precautions should be taken during mental health professionals training Mental health professionals should be equipped with current competencies to provide service to diverse groupsPurpose Although studies have separately examined the instructional design processes of novice designers and the pedagogical beliefs of novice teachers the manner through which they are linked is still unclear In this study the aim was to describe how preservice teachers pedagogical beliefs were embodied through instructional design practices within a real context Therefore having a closer look at the espoused and enacted beliefs in comparison to teaching performance from the instructional design perspective may contribute to facilitating and understanding novice teachers transfer of knowledge to practice Research Methods This was an instrumental case study withpreservice teachers The data were collected through observation portfolios and interviews Findings The results indicated that the participants tended towards blended beliefs but they failed to transfer them into practice Their teaching practices mostly included patterns of teachercentered approach Finally the match between espoused and enacted beliefs was not very common among the observed participants Implications for Research and Practice Since preservice teachers attend school practice during the last year of university they may feel isolated and unprepared for the application of studentcentered approaches That may be the reason why they put too much emphasis on control of the classroom If they had been practicing these approaches from the beginning of their university studies they would have left such anxieties behind and be more capable of transferring their espoused beliefs into enacted onesPurpose This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of implementing Project Based Learning PBL on the topic of statistics at a lower secondary school in Surabaya city Indonesia indicated by examining student learning outcomes student responses and student activity Research Methods A quasi experimental method was conducted over two months involving two classes of seventh grade students consisting an experiment class PBL and a control class conventional learning Data were collected through student activity observation sheets student responses and pretestposttests Data were analyzed by employing covariance analysis ANCOVA Findings Based on ANCOVA student learning outcomes in PBL are higher than those in conventional learning In addition based on the results of a descriptive analysis results of the student learning outcomes in PBL obtained more than the minimum standard score MSC the students responses in learning were positive and the students were active in the class activities Thus PBL is effective in statistical learning Implications for Research and Practice Based on the results of the research it can be concluded that PBL was effective in statistical learning These findings suggest that the students were enthusiastic in working the given project and actively discussed with other students in the class We suggest teachers apply PBL on other mathematics topics so students can be enthusiastic in mathematics learning in the class Alternatively teachers can use PBL with technologyassisted learning to make learning more interesting for studentsThe

experience are informed by many hours spent in schools and the pedagogiesboth effective and ineffectiveutilised by their teachers This research explores the influence of some of these prior experiences on preservice drama teachers beliefs about teaching drama this being important in the way that not only shapes their practicum experiences but also what will then influence their own teaching of drama Individual interviews with four preservice drama teachers revealed the complexity and dynamics of these participants lived experience with narrative portraits constructed as part of the process of inquiry This process not only built on the ways that knowledge is constructed and the beliefs and values that underscore these but also how these are shared and made known Three key beliefs emerged First drama both provides and creates a sense of belonging belonging being key for students and integral to the work of drama teachers Second drama education can promote selfdiscovery and personal development having therefore the potential to transform lives Third effective drama teachers are valued as hardworking highly skilled professionals dedicated to bringing out their students potential This paper emphasises the importance for preservice drama teachers to be aware of how their beliefs and subjectivities both influence their own experiences and consequently have influence over the ways they work with students in the drama spaceMany classroom teachers turn to arts integration as a method for meeting multiple learning objectives but are less than prepared to do so The Collaborative Residency program offered classroom teachers an intensive course of study through collaborative work with teaching artists as they coplanned and cotaught arts integrated units together Consistent with the literature participants in this study experienced the educational advantages of teaching through the arts to help students gain acquire and construct understanding The results of this study highlight the interdependence of classroom teachers personal beliefs behaviors and their environment as well as the need for better institutional support to provide classroom teachers a ground on which they can continue their arts integration endeavorsTeachers subject matter knowledge pedagogical content knowledge skills attitudes and selfefficacy guide teachers behaviour in the classroom Little is understood how preservice teachers beliefs affective and conative abilities along with creative potential support their technological and engineering behaviour necessary for inventiveness The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among preservice teachers attitudes towards technology perceptions and experiences with their own engagement in technology and engineering activities and their creative potential that have been shown to support their innovative behaviour A total ofpreservice teachers participated in this study The TwentyfiveItem Technology and Me survey the Test of Creative ThinkingDivergent Production and the Twentythreeitem Action and Me survey were used to measure the teachers attitudes towards technology creative potential and their situational interest perceived course learning value satisfaction and technological and engineering behaviour A conceptual model was hypothesized tested and supported by the results using confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modelling Findings indicate that preservice teachers who had higher scores on interest for technology had higher situational interest higher creative performance and higher ability to innovate Students who had higher scores on perceived consequences of technology had less creative performance while students who had higher scores on perceived technology difficulty had lower scores on perceived learning value of the course and lower scores on course design quality Preservice teachers own creativity perceived course design situational interest and perceived learning value mediate the relationship between attitudes towards technology and perceived ability to innovate Our results offer important implications about how to prepare preservice technology and engineering teachers for innovative performance towards enhancing technological knowledge and skillsSignalong Indonesia SI a key word signing approach was created to support the development of Indonesian inclusive schools A mixed methods approach collected data about teachers beliefs and experiences regarding SI from the first two schools to pilot it Thirtytwo teachers completed questionnaires followed by interviews with nine teachers Three themes emerged understanding the nature of SI the stigmatisation of signers and its reporting by teachers and the nature of happiness in inclusive pedagogy The latter reveals for the first time the importance of italicSukaitalic as a culturally mediated intrinsic part of Indonesian inclusive pedagogy The findings suggest recommendations about SI materials and training and indicate a new research area regarding inclusive pedagogies within different culturesThe basic aim of the study was to determine the power of mathematics and science selfefficacy resources as the predictors of academic success The relational scanning model was used in the study and the study was conducted withstudents who were studying at sixth and seventh grades of a state school The mathematics and science selfefficacy resources scales were used as the data collection tool In addition the school reports of the semester before the study was conducted were used to determine the academic success levels of the students The Pearson moments multiplication correlation technique and multiple linear regression analysis were used in the analysis of the data According to the results there were significant relations between the mathematics and science selfefficacy resources and the academic success levels at high medium and low levels The personal experiences indirect experiences and social persuasions which have significant effects on academic success both for mathematics and for science explained nearlyof the change in academic success The physiological situations towards mathematics did not have any significant effects on academic success According to the findings some recommendations have also been made in the studyThe author reflects on the articles about science education that were published in the journal in the pastyears as of MayTopics discussed include inquirybased learning science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education the technological pedagogical content knowledge TPACK theory the trends in international mathematics and science study TIMSS and programme for international student assessment PISAOne of the most important objectives of the science education includes helping students to think about the nature of scientific inquiries like a scientist and keep this point of view in order to understand the events occurring around them This research aims tocompare secondary school students views who have creative dramaconventional educationabout scientific inquiryand whether the experimental and control group students views about scientific research differ depending on gender after process Preexperimental design with control group was used in this research The sample of this research consisted ofstudents of th grade secondary school in Samsun Turkey The data were collected by using VOSIE questionnaire Data collected with VOSIE were analyzed using grouping standards and students were classified as novice transition and expert The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and nonparametric chisquare test Research results show that when compared to conventional activities in terms of developing positive views about scientific inquiry creative drama activities lead higher number of students to expert level Also it was found out that the number of students in expert category in experimental group was higher than those in control group at the end of education processThe purpose of this research was to explore and compare the ideas of Saudi boys and girls on animal species Eightyfour children comprisingboys andgirls aged nine years from four primary schools participated in structured interviews to determine their ideas pertaining to taxonomic labels namely animal fish amphibian reptile bird mammal and insect The results demonstrated that Saudi children of both genders display a wide range of alternative conceptions more specifically the effect of gender was significant for all taxonomic vertebrate labels suggesting that Saudi boys have better knowledge relating to animals than girls However generally children did not have adequate forms of reasoning for biological classification It was also found that none of the fourth graders thought of humans as animals due to the Islamic science worldview Based on these findings it is argued that science education notably in an international context should strive to incorporate an understanding of local values and beliefsThis research aimed to examine the impact of caricature drawings in the acquisition of scientific concepts and attitudes of th grade students for basic education towards science The sample of the research consisted ofstudents fromth grade The results revealed that there were statistically significant differences at p between the two groups in acquisition of scientific concepts in favour of experimental group In addition to that females scored significantly more than males in the posttest p whereas the interaction between group and gender was not significant The results also indicated that there were statistically significant differences p between the two group in the attitudes towards science in favour of experimental group scores The gender also has a significant impact on developing positive attitudes towards science in favour of females whereas the interaction between group and gender was not significant Finally there was a statistically significant difference p between pre and postapplication of students attitudes towards science scale in favour of postapplication for the experimental group Accordingly the research recommends the use of caricature drawings to help students in the acquisition of scientific concept and developing positive attitudes towards scienceSaudi students science academic performance has declined as evidenced by TIMSS Saudi science teachers are characterized as using the lecture format without considering individual student differences and failing to provide differentiated Method DM This paper reports on an effort to help female Saudi preservice science teachers PSST develop DI knowledge and skills striving to discern how they understood and practiced differentiation during their field experience after completing a speciallydesigned DMfocused university course A mixed method research design followed a sequential connected approach wherein quantitative data were collected through classroom observations N using a Likert scale observation instrument followed by qualitative interviews n The pre and post averages of differentiated teaching skills in the DM planning stage were statistically significant p The PSSTs moved from very small to moderate mastery on virtually allplanning items fromtoon a fivepoint Likert scale The DM implementation stageitems also reflected a statistically significant difference with scores moving fromtomoderate mastery Interview qualitative data confirmed and elucidated the quantitative results The course was deemed effective in developing PSSTs differentiated teaching skills statistically significant p Teaching PSSTs about DM should improve Saudi students science academic achievementThis research examined the effect of a course designed with different content on preservice science teachers selfefficacy beliefs and knowledge about organizing curriculumbased trips A pretest posttest quasi experimental design was used in the research Onehundred and thirty preservice science teachers participated in the research The research was carried out within the context of an elective course called Informal Learning Environments in Science Education and was conducted overweeks in total for two hours per week The research data were obtained by means of a questionnaire selfefficacy scale for designing curriculumbased field trips CFTSES and semistructured focusgroup interviews As a result of the research it was found that the course content which included inclass and outofschool setting practices in the rd group was the most effective This was followed by the nd group which included only inclass implementations The first group which was supported with visuals and theoretical related presented information was the group which was the least effected The results of the research revealed that preservice science teachers had mainly different concerns about safety but that this did not deter them as they still continued to design curriculumbased field trips for learnersIn this research word association test was used to explore the cognitive structure of Preservice science teachers about biological energy metabolism The participant group constitutesPreservice students at a university in Black Sea Region of Turkey Ten key concepts in General Biology course were given as a stimulating word and a mind map was established by using the frequency values of valid response words The results showed that the total number of different response words for the key word enzyme is the highest with cell and energy being higher than others and for the key word photosynthesis is the lowest The mind map also showed that they based their cognitive perceptions of the biological energy mechanism mostly on scientific concepts that are emphasized in the lessons and are academically acknowledged and included in the concepts used in everyday life at the least However they were not able to see the key concept enzymes as a part of branched network and they had also problems regarding the respiratory event in the plants as well as realization process of photosynthesis in the cellular level Implications of the results in terms of understanding the subject of biological energy metabolism are also discussedThe Next Generation Science Standards explicitly endorse argumentation as essential practices for K science classrooms because it can concurrently engage the learners in the coordination of conceptual epistemic and social goals It is important to develop students capacities to interpret information and data to reasonable evidence and make appropriate justification to debate with peers in argumentative practice This article introduces a series of activities progressively encompassing the concepts of argumentation and explicitly connecting argumentation to the E inquiry model The activities that do not depend on any specific science content can be introduced to any teaching methods course It is our hope that this lesson and the activities that we used can spark ideas for teachers in diverse settings That will encourage educators to craft their own lesson to foster student understanding of argument and argumentation application of this knowledge to specific science content and ability to make connections to inquiryThis paper aims at grasping the digital culture of teachers participating in an Italian teachers induction context by referring to the Finnish Opeka theoretical and methodological model Namely we grasp how Southern Italy participants in a TFA course aimed at educate to teach students with special educational needs shape their own digital culture We first describe how the general context of TFA is featured as one of the possible teachers induction paths in Italy Then we show both analysis and results of the research As for this we first run Principal Component Analysis to detect what factors compose the participants digital culture Then we run independent samples ttest to observe differences between males and females and preservice and inservice teachers indeed even if all of the teachers are attending the TFA as an induction experience some of them already work in fields different from the special educational needs one Results show that two of the four detected factors are similar to those proposed by the Finnish literature The other two instead differ from them Furthermore it emerged that on average males have higher scores than females on the factors these differences are significant on three factors Last but not the least experienced teachers have on average higher scores than preservice participants However these differences are not significantThe purpose of the study was to scrutinize and explain the academic social and athletic experiences of international studentathletes attending a historically Black university Participants were six international studentathletes five men and one woman Situated in position theory the research design was explanatory multiple case study The primary data collection method was semistructured interviews The interviews were analyzed using a constant comparative approach and revealed that the participants were positioned by language differences and academic difficulties were disengaged from some teammates and endured athletic disadvantages in resources and training To amply support international studentathletes we assert that athletic departments coaches faculty and students should respect and value the identities as well as the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of international studentathletesThis study aims at investigating the relevance among three factors preservice English teachers preparation courses their views about teaching and their real teaching behaviors This is a case study focusing on three preservice teachers of English in Egypt Data was collected through three tools an observation sheet a semistructured interview and a focus group Results of the study revealed that there is a gap between what preservice English teachers learn in their preparation courses their views about effective teaching and their real behaviors in class The reasons which the participants gave for not applying what they have learned theoretically include insufficient preservice training students low level insufficient class time students resistance of changing the way they are used to learn insufficiency of equipment in schools students preference of using the native language in learning and in one case the teacher herself preferred the traditional grammar translation method The study recommends early coordination between teacher preparation institutions and schools The study recommends the incorporation of senior teachers in teacher preparation programs to try to breach the theorypractice gap The study also recommends that teacher educators should analyze the given causes of the theorypractice gap and develop the English teachers preparation courses in accordanceThis study is an attempt to find out the use of conceptual metaphors of teachers by the highschool students based upon Oxford et al taxonomyIn so doing seventy participants were randomly selected among the highschool students of both genders agedtoin RezvanshahrA city in Guilan province The questionnaires were distributed required them to jot down their own conceptual metaphor about their teachers The gathered information was analyzed through SPSS software after codifying The results showed that most frequent class of metaphors used by them were LearnerCentered Growth It is meant that Iranian students like their teachers to be the facilitators who pave the way for them On the other hand there exists no significant relationship between gender and the type of metaphors that students use about their teachersIt is believed that authentic reading materials can link students to contextual use of English as they can improve students communicative and cultural competences Related to point this is very important to highlight the investigation on teachers beliefs about authentic reading materials as it is reflected through the teachers expectation and how they manifest them in classroom practices This is a case study of four teachers who teach English at public senior high school in Samarinda East Kalimantan The study explores the beliefs of these teachers about authentic reading materials in their classroom practices The data were taken from a semi structured interview classroom observation and teachers written documents The study revealed that there were three themes of teachers beliefs emergedtypes of authentic reading materialsskills to be improved after reading andteachers challenges of using authentic reading materials for the classroombases It is noted that teachers did selfadjustment when manifesting their beliefs in classroom activities In addition Teachers needs selfmanagement when utilizing authentic materialsThis investigation examines the impact teacher protection and principal roie ambiguity have on elementary school student bullying Data were collected fromteachers andcampus administrators fromelementary schools in Texas HLM analyses are employed to identify the effect that teacher protection administrator role ambiguity school size and socioeconomic status have on student bullying The findings indicate when teachers espouse a belief in protecting students from bullying and administrators clearly understand their roles bullying incidents decrease Thus enhancing teacher protection and administrator role clarity may serve as useful tools to help educators reduce incidents of school bullyingBlack boys in racially segregated urban schools are vulnerable to the trappings of the schooltoprisonpipeline In this article I use narrative inquiry and critical race theory CRT to examine the stories of two elementary school principals struggling to create more inclusive schools for Black boys with emotional disabilities ED in a racially segregated and lowperforming district Each principal narrative describes efforts to transition a student with ED from a districtcreated selfcontained program to a fulltime or nearfulltime placement in an inclusive general education classroom Despite the principals overall success in creating more inclusive schools for most students with disabilities in a challenging district context each principal narrative ends with a student being unsuccessful in an inclusive setting and returned to a segregated program The findings highlight how principals who recognize the vulnerability of Black boys in special education are compelled to create more inclusive schools but can confront significant institutional organizational and social and emotional challenges Applying CRT to these cases provides additional insights into how principals can develop inclusive schools and challenge segregated programs While some inclusive leadership practices aimed at improving the educational outcomes of Black boys are identified throughout these narratives the significance of the study lies in documenting and understanding how principals experience the barriers and challenges to creating more socially just and inclusive schoolsThis qualitative study explored Spanishspeaking teacher credential students beliefs about academic language that might promote or inhibit their decision to become bilingual teachers Data includes interviews withbilingual teacher candidates who were heritage Spanish speakers Findings show that most were only aware of Englishonly educational contexts and did not know that bilingual teaching and the bilingual authorization pathway were options Their schooling experience fostered English hegemony even their Spanish classes were pervaded by linguistic purism and elitism Schools taught them that their registers of Spanish which they learned at home were insufficient inappropriate or incorrect Consequently they questioned their ability to become bilingual teachers Language register and social class were intimately connected in the data Participants viewed bilingual education as a pathway toward more equitable educational opportunities for Latinx students Implications include the need for bilingual teacher preparation to address critical sociolinguistics concepts that explore the relationships between language race and ethnicity in education Future research is needed to explore how heritage Spanish speaking bilingual teachers enact their beliefs about equity through bilingual education the challenges they face and the ways that teacher education programs and professional development providers could support their workThe New Zealand school curriculum was last revised inat which time a new emphasis was placed on culture in language teaching The practice of intercultural language teaching is implicit in the curriculum document and explicit in the curriculum guide which features a set of principles for intercultural communicative language teaching iCLT This article presents a study on the extent to which New Zealand language teachers beliefs and practices are aligned with intercultural language teaching ILT A questionnaire administered to New Zealand language teachers included a number of items used in a seminal sevennation comparative study conducted by Lies Sercu and her colleagues as well as other items developed from relevant literature Expanding on previous studies use of itembyitem analyses multiitem scales to measure alignment of New Zealand teachers beliefs and practices with ILT were developed which yielded good internal reliabilities The findings revealed an apparent mismatch between beliefs and practices with teachers being favourably disposed towards ILT but not practising the approach in their classrooms Interpretation of the data using concepts from teacher cognition research suggested that the differences represented tensions between teachers abstract theoretical beliefs and their concrete practical beliefs We argue that supporting teachers applied knowledge of developing intercultural communicative competence ICC will allow them to recognize that those beliefs need not be discordantBased on the examined literary sources the article briefly reviews the development of research on teachers work motivation The main contemporary research areas are highlighted Three of these areas are analyzed in detail the motivation for selecting the teacher profession by students in teacher education the factors influencing the motivation of teachers and demotivational factorsThe article examines how power and decision making is distributed in school systems by addressing common misconceptions on influence and the effects on teaching learning and school leading It discusses how administrators teachers and students all have the ability to demonstrate power and revise how educational systems operateThis research analysed future teachers perceptions and attitudes towards the use of Information and Communication Technologies ICTs in the development of inclusive educational practices Adopting a quantitative research approach data were collected through an ad hoc questionnaire administered to fourthyear early childhood education and primary education degree students from the Catholic University of Murcia UCAM southeast Spain n Results revealed favourable perceptions towards ICT use in the classroom with students viewing these resources as contributing to their professional development and improving digital competence Furthermore they report how ICTs present didactic opportunities for the development of the teachinglearning process when working with learners with specific educational support needs Lastly the research highlights statistically significant differences in future teachers perceptions towards the implications of ICT for teaching when developing inclusive educational processes as well as in their attitudes towards professional development and the training needs required for supporting learners with special educational needs These differences are appreciated between early childhood education degree students and their primary education peers the latter reporting more favourable assessmentsIn this article we consider how an ELA inquirybased curriculum centered on technology provided avenues for students to share beliefs about their own identities and the world around them Through classroom observations interviews with students and teachers and analysis of the work produced by students in three thgrade English classrooms this study builds on existing assumptions about the role technology plays in schools Rather than simply noting how technology enables and strengthens digital production practices and access in English classrooms we argue that technology mediates student identities and helps students articulate the complex cultural experiences and beliefs that they bring daily into schools Further by exploring how student beliefs about identity and society were couched in statements about technology this study connects English classroom discussions about technology to broader understandings of the world beyond schools Through our analysis of student talk student writing and classroom observations we identified three ways that students described technology When engaging in the curriculum students represented technology as invisible or in relation to humanity and frequently explored the relationship between technology society and power Ultimately this study suggests that when considering how technology layers meanings of power within schools we must view technology according to the domains in which it does and does not count in students eyes The implementation of technology in English classrooms is far more complicated than the utilization of tools It is about power student identity and positioningTeachers in classrooms with linguistically diverse students face the difficult challenge of honoring students home languages and dialects while also helping students acquire Standardized English This charge is particularly challenging because English classrooms have historically been sites where Standardized English is held up as the one correct version of English while all other forms of English are viewed as deviant deficient errors This study explores the teaching and talk about language of five high school English teachers attempting to promote a critical understanding of language variation during a literature unit Data from interviews and classroom observations illustrate how teachers grappled with dominant language ideologies during moments of teaching and talk about language Despite their stated goals all the teachers but one reinforced dominant language ideologies by drawing on the available discourses of the Standardized English master narrative that pervades English classrooms and society at large Through careful attention to her speech one teacher managed to craft a consistent counternarrative that worked to highlight existing language hierarchies Findings highlight teaching situations where language ideologies are particularly salient and demonstrate how different approaches to talk about language in those situations communicate different language ideologies Implications for supporting teachers critical language teaching including major ideological shifts toward thinking about language as a social process are consideredThis article aims to discuss the concept of teacher professional development and its implication in the teacher education processes of Marcelo Garcaand OliveiraFormosinhosstudies The following basic questions form the basis of the discussion What teaching practices can contribute to the teacher development process What reflections are necessary so that the work space that is the school and its specificities can participate in the professional development process of the teachers The results of this conceptual reflection show the need to research and value the formative spaces of teachers in order to prioritize mainly the intentionality of working on the personal dimension of the teacher in the formative spaces of teachers whether initial or continuing teacher educationAutonomy is a site of political struggle it is essential for teachers but challenged in relation to global policies and standardised testing In this qualitative study the accounts of Canadian and Finnish mathematics uppersecondary school teachers are examined in relation to their perceptions of autonomy Teachers report on similar autonomous classroom operations and similar hindrances to autonomy in schoolwide operations However contrasting outlooks on autonomy were found among the Finnish and Canadian teachers This contrast informs us about the role culture plays in the different ways autonomy is internalised and perceived by teachers The findings deepen the understanding of autonomy for teachers as well as its implications in different contextsThis article focuses on the processes that come into play as part of a school development project and how these processes contribute to strengthening teacher professionalism Through processes of consciousness raising and the development of learning cultures where tacit knowledge becomes explicit and shared and new practices are tested out and discussed teacher professionalism is developed further The study shows that this kind of school development work gives the teachers ownership of the development process and strengthens their consciousness about their own teaching as well as develops the learning cultures at the school Thus this development becomes an important way in which to reinforce the teachers professional knowledge responsibility and autonomyIn traditional learning students passively absorb the materials provided by their teachers or textbooks Thus their learning autonomy is insufficient and this affects learning motivation Students find it difficult to absorb the knowledge taught in a classroom and apply it to real life We combined situated learning and learning through drama to help realize students autonomy and ownership A situational learning system using a comic play was devised to help students learn through scriptwriting in groups When learning through drama the visual aids on stage can provide students with a sense of immersion which strengthens their knowledge application This method was applied during Englishlanguage courses of fifthgrade students at an elementary school in Taiwan Students questionnaire responses demonstrated that using this system helped their autonomous learning The students sense of identification with their own work and their learning impressions were substantially improved Examination results of the students from the experimental group were significantly higher from those from a control group taught using traditional teaching methodsSummer enrichment and residential programs can provide gifted students with positive social interactions and challenging curricula However little research has focused on gifted students perceptions of the learning environment in such programs This research project evaluated the psychometric properties and practical applications of the Student Perceptions of Classroom Quality SPOCQ instrument The two studies used a total sample ofdiverse gifted students in Gradesthroughwho participated in a universitybased enrichment residential program fromthroughConfirmatory factor analysis results indicated that although the original model was a moderately good fit for the gifted student participants intosome items on the SPOCQ were classroom specific and did not apply to residential programs Therefore those items were revised and retested and results showed that the modified model was a better fit for gifted student participants into Teachers support of student autonomy in physical education PE is believed to be important for students motivation and outcomes in PE We tested the hypothesis that an intervention designed to help teachers to be more autonomy supportive in teaching their students to use learning strategies relative to standard teaching would increase students perceived autonomy support from the teachers perceived competence autonomous motivation use of learning strategies and their exertion participation and grades in PE over a school year We also tested a selfdetermination theory SDT process model Experimental effects of the intervention yielded significant positive effects on changes in perceived autonomy support learning strategies defined as absorption and effort regulation as well as for performance ie grades In testing the SDT process model with SEM most of the predicted paths were significantly supportedMost public school teachers in the United States now leave the classroom before reaching retirement Research on teacher attrition has tended to focus on novice teachers using human capital or organizational theories to understand trends in teacher exit This study examines the accounts of certified experienced teachers who left teaching after making significant investments in the career The accounts of these invested leavers are examined through a lens of resistance illuminating issues of power as well as the ideals of teaching that may be expressed through the decision to leaveWe investigated the extent to which perceived autonomy support PAS is associated with adaptability and in turn whether both are associated with emotional exhaustion and work disengagement The associations that all four factors have with organizational commitment were also examined With a sample ofAustralian secondary school teachers we conducted structural equation modeling Findings showed that PAS was positively associated with adaptability and negatively associated with exhaustion and disengagement Adaptability was negatively associated with disengagement Finally PAS positively exhaustion negatively and disengagement negatively were associated with organizational commitment Together the findings shed light on teachers workplace experiences and outcomesThis study examined whether teachers and students agree in their perceptions of the mastery goal structures dimensions task autonomy recognitionevaluation and grouping Additionally potential predictors namely students achievement and teachers basic psychological need satisfaction at work were investigated Using a sample ofsecondary school students and theirteachers results from multilevel structural equation models revealed moderate agreement for grouping and no agreement for the other dimensions Higher levels of achievement narrowed the gap between teachers and students perceptions of autonomy and recognitionevaluation No effects of need satisfaction were found for any of the mastery goal structures dimensionsThe aim of this experiment was to study the growthpromoting and adverse impact of athlete leaders competencesupportive andthwarting behavior on the motivation and performance of team members Male soccer players N MAge were allocated to adhoc teams of five soccer players These teams participated in two sessions being randomly exposed to an athlete leader who acted either competencesupportive competencethwarting or neutral during the second session When the athlete leader was competencesupportive versus competencethwarting his teammates intrinsic motivation and performance increased versus decreased compared with the control condition The leaders impact on intrinsic motivation was fully accounted for by team members competence satisfaction These findings recommend coaches to invest in the competencesupportive power of their athlete leaders to establish an optimally motivating and performanceenhancing team environmentThe issue of professional teaching standards has recently generated considerable interest of the Ministry of Education in KSA and elsewhere The purpose of this research paper was to examine the extent to which the Professional Standards for English language teachers are applied by the English language female student teachers at AlImam Muhammed Ibn Saud Islamic University The descriptive method was used The whole population N of all English language senior female student teachers during the second semester was sampled Data were gathered through a questionnaire The participants were asked to evaluate their competencies based on the given items in the questionnaire on apoint Likert scale ranging from incompetent to highly competent Findings revealed that the student teachers perceived themselves to be highly competent in language proficiency with the mean scoresand theoretical knowledgeHowever they were uncertain of their competency in the theoreticalcurriculum designand language pedagogyFindings were discussed in the light of the preparation program syllabus as well as previous related literature Based on the research results recommendations and suggestions for future studies were proposedThis paper describes research on how curriculum reform provides novel conditions for influencing teacher professionalism It draws on Bernsteins theories of the classification and framing of curriculum and theories of teacher professionalism to investigate the impact of curriculum reform on teacher professionalism The research was conducted in Indonesia during the implementation of a schoolbased curriculum that grants teachers greater autonomy to develop curricula appropriate to their context A second concurrent reform introduced a character education policy that requires all teachers to address a specific set of values in all classes Teachers working in public and Islamic private secondary schools were interviewed to investigate the degree of professionalism they exercised when implementing these reforms Although theories of curriculum reform suggest that the higher degree of autonomy offered by a schoolbased curriculum has the potential to reprofessionalise teachers this study observed different outcomes for teachers in different workforce environments in IndonesiaOver the last few years the effect that teachers beliefs have on the results achieved by their students has been widely studied Educational research has shown that the selfefficacy beliefs of teachers in their work influence their professional behavior and are associated with students achievement and motivation The main aim of this work is to study the personal and contextual factors determining the level of selfefficacy perceived by teachers in countries of the European Union which participated in TALISSpecifically it attempts to answer the following questions What are the main determinants of teachers selfefficacy beliefs Are these factors individual or contextual Do these determinants vary from country to country Taking into account the multistructural level of available data teachers Levelare nested within schools Levelin each country data analysis has been carried out by means of multilevel structural equation modeling More specifically a multigroup multilevel model has been designed to study the effect of teachers traits Levelpredictors and school traits Levelpredictors on the perceived level of selfefficacy in different countries The results show that variables relating to the teachers as professionals cooperation with their colleagues encouraging selfevaluation by the students teachers perception of satisfactory class discipline a need for professional development in the contents of the subject taught and in teaching skills and having a constructivist teaching approach are the ones most closely related to their selfefficacy beliefs These are more important than factors associated with the institutional setting in which they work ownership ratio or shortage of resources or strictly personal traits age gender or work situationThe authors aimed to investigate learning culture in classrooms at schools to understand education in Finland and South Korea For this Finnish and South Korean university students made observations on classrooms in partner countries and reflected on both education systems based on their own previous experiencesAfterwards researchers from both countries categorized and thematized the experiences of the participants and interpreted the main themes to figure out the learning culture in Finland and South Korea As a result the learning culture in both countries were characterized into six themes teachers autonomy in teaching authenticity in learning relationships between teachers and students learning assessment student engagement and student wellbeing Noteworthy features of highperforming education were recognized through the observation on the learning culture in both countriesThis article reports on the results of an action research study that aimed to determine the effect of a thinking routine in the development of coherence in speaking interactions The study was carried out with two groups of second year business students in an English as a foreign language program at a university in southern Chile A mixed methods approach was used to collect data before and after the intervention through questionnaires and pre and posttests The findings suggest that the impact of the application of the routine was significant in promoting the speaking competence especially in developing coherence within interactive communicationCurriculum reform with a schoolbased approach is often assumed to offer schools and teachers autonomy at the site level thus enabling them to develop a schoolbased curriculum and pedagogies to better fit the needs of students Over the past decade schoolbased curriculum development in Hong Kong has encountered issues that deserve worldwide attention and discussion By reviewing the experiences of two schools in Hong Kong and drawing on international evidence this study identifies key challenges and difficulties in schoolbased curriculum reform in three areas Intellectually there is a lack of a strong and broad shared knowledge base for curriculum development As a result most schoolbased curriculum initiatives have been piecemeal fragmented and shallow Structurally many teachers have wasted time reinventing the wheel when developing schoolbased curricula This effort has left them without sufficient time and energy to be effective in teaching Culturally reliance on school management to steer schoolbased reforms has prevented the development of a new culture in which teachers have the autonomy to make changes in their daily practices Without cultural changes curriculum reforms are not sustainable or effective This study proposes a cooperative platform that integrates the strengths of central intelligence and schoolbased initiatives to maximise support for curriculum development at the teacher schoolsite and system levelsAbstract Inquiry provides opportunities to engage students in authentic science Although inquirys underlying principles can motivate students to learn the challenges that students encounter may hamper their motivation Thus the teachers role in providing motivational support is crucial This research examines how the interplay among the inquirys characteristics the challenges encountered by students and the motivational support provided by the teacher affects students expression of motivation throughout an online inquiry process The messages of both the teacher and the students were examined using selfdetermination theory SDT The results indicate that the students did not automatically embrace the autonomous characteristic of open inquiry Their expressions of motivation were dynamic affected by the challenges that they encountered In contrast the teacher maintained high levels of autonomy and competence and intertwined these components in a strategy that we term guided autonomy The teacher and students expressed highorder expressions of affect In addition we found a positive correlation between the teachers motivational support and the students expressions of motivation The results indicate that SDT can provide a powerful framework for understanding students unfolding motivation throughout a challenging educational process and for guiding teachers efforts in supporting the motivation of their students in an online environmentTeachers beliefs about teaching and learning are constructed over a lifetime of experiences in classrooms This nineyear longitudinal study examines preservice teachers initial educational beliefs and the changes in those beliefs over their teacher preparation program and into their first six years of teaching Analysis of questionnaires interviews and surveys from six teachers revealed that they initially believed that students were similar to themselves that students in the same grade have similar abilities that teaching was simple and that teachers function autonomously Nine years later they believed that students differ from one another and from themselves that differentiating instruction is essential but difficult that teaching is complex and that teaching is often constrained by outside factors The data suggested a common progression from initial idealism to cognitive dissonance to a search for an authentic teaching persona to confidence in their new role as teacher and then to diminished idealismEdcamps are a voluntary democratic form of unconference This paper presents participants perceptions regarding the impact of Edcamps Data were gathered from a survey and interviewsNParticipants overwhelmingly reported that Edcamp experiences caused changes in their practices and in student learning The impacts of Edcamps were often described in terms of student engagement experiences and dispositions rather than traditional measures of achievement such as test scores Participants experienced various obstacles and supports as they utilized what they had learned at Edcamps Considering these results the Edcamp model and its implications for other forms of teacher learning are discussedThe author focuses on Great Britains education systems and their transition sinceIt discusses the education policies such as Education Act ERAERAand Education Reform ActTopics include education and politics impact of British withdrawal from the European Union Brexit on academies and community schools and General Certificate of Secondary Education GCSEAcademic writing is a social practice in which the writer interacts with both texts and people and uses the interaction as a learning resource While academic interaction in the classroom setting has been extensively investigated student interaction that takes place without teacher supervision remains largely unexplored Since autonomy is a key component of academic interaction autonomous peer feedback practices among postgraduate students may be of some interest This paper reports on an exploratory case study of peer feedback among a small group of postgraduate students in a masters programme in translation studies in a prestigious Chinese University The findings offer insights into the role of peer feedback in advancing academic literacy and forming scholarly communities in an emerging discipline The case study provides an opening into the research area of autonomous peer feedback and suggests avenues for further more substantial researchTo examine different approaches to teacher autonomy in nationstates three countries were selected for a comparative study Estonia Finland and Germany The emphasis of the study lies on the subjective perceptions of upper secondary school teachers italicnitalic semistructured interviews regarding their curricular autonomy and experiences of being controlled by the system The article discusses different concepts of teacher autonomy and agency theoretically and concludes that they are partly overlapping but not the same Agency can be understood as the realistic actualization of autonomy within the constraints of the teaching profession while autonomy is in theory more liberating focusing on selfdirectedness capacity for autonomous action and freedom from control The data analysis showed that the expectations of teachers as to the amount of desired autonomy varied greatly While the Finnish teachers in the study perceived control over teachers work to be unnecessary due to their high professionalism the Estonian and German teachers did not advocate absence of control instead preferring to have complete freedom to choose within limitsThis article presents the results of research aimed at finding out how training in media education is being developing in Spanish Universities From a methodological perspective this work is part of what can be considered a mixed research paradigm In the first phase the content ofstudy guides fromSpanish universities was analysed using a thematic coding system to analyse the data In the second phaseindepth interviews were conducted with university teachers in charge of teaching subjects related to media education in order to understand how they were developing these experiences methodologies used systems of assessment etc The results show that the presence of dimensions of media education in curricula is unequal and that teachers are using a wide range of teaching methods and evaluation tools This study suggests that the education authorities and university teachers should rethink training for future teachers and include contents that facilitate understanding the functioning of the media as a way of accessing diverse cultural representationsThe aim of this study was to explore lower secondary school students experiences of using the school grounds as a learning environment School grounds were used on a regular basis during two to three years mainly in mathematics and German as a third language Fourteen students were interviewed about their experiences The way outdoor learning was implemented facilitated studentcentred and cooperative learning which was considered positive in terms of academic as well as emotional dimensions Perceptions regarding ontask orientation were more varied and included experiences of increased as well as decreased ontask orientation Teachers control could be poorer outdoors resulting in a negative influence on ontask orientation This study contributes to previous research on outdoor learning by focusing on regular schoolbased outdoor learning in a secondary school contextAims The progression of students within Alternative Provision AP who have social emotional and behavioural difficulties SEBD has frequently been identified as an area of concern A qualitative study was conducted to explore the factors that lead to the successful progression of students in a Further Education FE AP The studys strengths and limitations are discussed as well as the implications for practice development and growth Method Eight semistructured interviews were conducted with students between the ages ofwho had progressed from FE AP into mainstream college Interview transcripts were analysed and coded using thematic analysis Findings The main organising themes identified were full accessible and diverse curriculum positive and holistic learning environment student motivation staff understanding of social emotional and behavioural difficulties and adult environment Through reflecting on the organising themes the global theme of supportive and personalised learning experience was identified The young people interviewed greatly valued education being tailored to meet their needs through informed personalised and welldelivered behaviour management strategies implemented by staff Highlevel facilities and resources combined with the above provided a holistic educational experience that promoted the learners academic and social enhancement and motivation It also appears that through being in an adult environment the social and emotional development of these younger learners was enhanced Conclusion To assist the outcomes of young people who enter into a FE AP it appears that there is a need to develop a diverse and creative educational experience which has been created to meet each young persons individual needs This research suggests that highly skilled supportive understanding and available staff enhance this learning experience The above seems to be facilitated by students having an Aha moment when they spontaneously decide to change their less favourable behaviours It is possible that experiencing a combining sense of autonomy competence and relatedness which are important factors in motivation facilitate this moment of realisationConsiderable resources are expended on the development of learner autonomy LA and in particular on the provision of selfaccess facilities as one of the most common ways in which institutions have tried to foster autonomy Whether the intended outcomes are achieved depends in large part on teachers agreement with and understanding of the rationale behind these efforts A mismatch between an institutional objective and a classroom implementation may for example negatively impact the student experience This project looks at teachers perspectives on LA and selfaccess language learning in a university setting where a selfaccess component was introduced as a compulsory element of students firstyear courses How do teachers conceptualise autonomous learning what importance do they assign to it and how do they attempt to foster autonomy in practice What role do they see for selfaccess learning in this In this project we used a mixedmethods approach and obtained questionnaire data fromteachers on an English as a Foreign Language programme at a university in Thailand as well as qualitative data from indepth interviews withteachers on their beliefs about autonomy and selfaccess The results show a complex interplay between teachers beliefs institutional constraints and classroom implementationThis article briefly examines and explains the theory of social ecology and the political theory of libertarian municipalism as developed by the late Murray Bookchinas a possible comprehensive framework for a secondary curriculum centered upon an anarchistic and ecological ethics The author first offers an investigation of the philosophical foundations of social ecology and the political theory of libertarian municipalism and their implications for how we think about and practice education Next the author shares findings from an empirical study conducted at a small charter high school in a large metropolitan area that utilizes social ecology and communitybased education to move its students toward enhanced selfactualization through active participation in nurturing greater community autonomy and in addressing social and environmental injustice The aim of sharing these findings is to provide insight into how social ecology is understood and used by teachers and students within a school to foster social and ecological responsibility and activism on the community levelThe article discusses several activities that impact student progress and achievement in literacy at rural school Girraween Primary School Topics include the practices teachers engage in to build capacity and establish practices common between classes Girraweens partnerships with parents and local establishments and creation of an inquiry unit for yearstudents for Girraween Primary Schools Field DayThis study examined Syrian refugee English as a Foreign Language EFL learners perceptions regarding learner autonomy as well as their readiness for autonomy in English language learning It also investigated the effects of grade and gender on learners perceptions A mixedmethod research design was utilized and findings indicated that neither grade nor gender had caused statistically significant differences in terms of Syrian refugees perceptions of learner autonomy in language learning nevertheless both had caused statistically significant differences in terms of subscales While thegraders in this study perceived themselves as being more autonomous in terms of experience in language learning the female students seemed more autonomous in terms of their perceptions of the role of teachers and feedback Additionally although the learners perceptions regarding autonomy were slightly lower than their readiness for autonomy there was a statistically significant relationship between their perceptions of learner autonomy and their readiness for autonomy in language learning When their perceptions about learner autonomy increased their readiness for autonomy also increasedIn Japan there are a number of selfaccess centres which through hard work collaboration and support have succeeded in establishing unique identities for themselves However as encouraging as this is there are still universitybased selfaccess centres within the country where the opposite is true In this article one selfaccess centres struggle to form a unique identity for itself will be examined Discussion will first focus on understanding the history of the centre and underlying reasons for why this problem persists Thereafter attention will be turned to ambitious efforts being made to deal with the issue in light of longstanding limitations imposed by the universitys administrationWith the development of educational technology teachers authority is dispelled the relation between teachers and students is faced with a new transition The ultimate goal of teachers authority is to cultivate students autonomy Teachers authority is a kind of rational authority which has sown selfdestroyed seeds in the process of promoting the development of students autonomy Freedom and authority oughtnt to be positioned in opposition In the Internet era teachers authority should be transformed into the authority of distinguishing and sorting out information knowledge integrating and innovating values clarificating and reconstructing heuristic teaching The development of educational technology and the dispelling of teachers authority have made the establishment of students autonomy necessary and possibleConnecting schools and teachers with industry and community partners is essential for improving STEM outcomes for students To address this two pilot STEM Hubs were created for schools in Brisbane and Townsville that connected secondary STEM teachers with local industry and community partners The collaboration afforded innovative STEM units to be conceptualised by teachers and partners and then developed by pre service teachers at partner universities This study reports on the perspectives of the teachers industry partners and preservice teachers who collaborated with university representatives to write the units of work known as STEMROD STEM Resources on Demand Data from student and partner interviews were used to ascertain the affordances and constraints of the STEMROD initiative The analysis revealed three positive outcomes firstly the STEMROD approach can relieve teacher workload by providing an initial resource that can be modified to suit students needs secondly the STEMROD were written to align with schools priorities in the STEM area by providing opportunities for integrated STEM teaching and learning and thirdly the STEMROD were written to afford opportunities for pre service teachers to practice curriculum planning as well as receive valuable feedback from teachersFor decades the term learner autonomy has been the focus of many studies in the field of education and language learning This study addresses teachers perspectives of learner autonomy in Saudi Arabia It examines whether teachers have the knowledge to encourage and foster learnerautonomy This study also seeks to explore the challenges English language teachers face in the process of implementing learner autonomy into their EFL classrooms The investigation was conducted using a sample ofEnglish language teachers teaching Saudi students at King AbdulAziz University Data was collected using a item questionnaire The study was a mixed research method Collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis The findings revealed that teachers believe that Saudi learners in the current situation are nonautonomous learners they lack the knowledge and the training to apply it Findings also revealed that teachers are familiar with the learnerautonomy yet they stated that they need proper training and professional development to help encourage learner autonomy It is an attempt to contribute to the literature underlying learner autonomy in the field of language learning in the Saudi context Also it suggests further research to help better comprehend the value of teachers role in the process of autonomous language learning for learnersThe main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a week water aerobics program in a reallife context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults Fifteen volunteersyears old were part of an experimental group Exercise and eight volunteersyears old were part of the control group Control The Exercise performedmin of water aerobics twice a week forweeks no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period The evaluations were performed the week before pretraining and after the training program posttraining The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry lipid profile and blood pressure Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in posttraining moment However there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs p reduced body fat p reduced systolic blood pressure p and triglycerides p in Exercise Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbsmCI ES In addition there was a significant decrease in fat mass CI ES and in the systolic blood pressuremmHg ES Nonetheless no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile These results suggest thatweeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a reallife context seem to benefit the explosive strength body composition and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profilesThe article presents questions and answers related to education in Great Britain including national funding arrangements for adult education funding requirements for specialist providers affected by the devolution of the adult education budget and Disabled Students AllowancesThe article presents the written weekly educationalrelated parliamentary questions to the House of Commons Department for Education DfE in Great Britain The topics discussed include the eligibility for support for the diverse national funcing on adult education the DfEs funding policy from the digital vouchers of the Apprenticeship Levy that firms did not expend with the time limit of two years and the number of companies in England that failed to spend their apprenticeship levyEducational systems across the world are applying measures addressed to the improvement of education quality These measures have as a consequence the shaping of a rhetoric that works as a framework for the interpretation of educational agents action The article deals with the analysis of the impact of global educational policies on the notions of educational agents teachers and parentsautonomy freedom and participation within the Madrilenian educational system To this end it takes as a context the meaning given to these notions within the Spanish educational system through the analysis of its evolution over the national education laws Next it presents the reform applied to the Madrilenian educational system through facing the policy makers speeches and the educational legislation that they have enacted The results show that the impact of the reform leads to the limitation of teachers autonomy the erosion of parents participation and the narrowing of parents freedomIn the present study hierarchical linear modeling with random intercept models was used to estimate the impact school and teacherlevel factors had on K teachers perceptions of school influence curricular and pedagogical autonomy and job satisfaction in the early years of the Race to the Top Era The main predictors investigated were whether students standardized test scores were used as a component of either a teachers formal teacher evaluation or compensation as well as whether teachers worked in a Race to the Top state Additional school and teacherlevel predictors included percentage minority teachers and

strategies in Finnish educational policy documents dealing with digitalization The documents argue that the national education system is in dire need of digital technologies in order to modernize its pedagogy and secure national economic competitiveness Finnish municipalities schools and teachers have high levels of autonomy in implementing curricula so there is a challenge to them to adopt digitalization at all levels of educationStandardised curriculum or standardized lesson plans SLPs have become an accepted strategy to support and improve instructional practices in schools worldwide These standardised lesson plans SLPs were criticized in the s and s for deskilling the teaching profession and reducing the work of teachers to that of mere technicians This critique is now returning at a time of growing regulation of teachers work in many school systems In this paper we investigate the potential and limitations of the SLPs which are the main component of the Gauteng Primary Language and Mathematics Strategy GPLMS a largescale multipronged instructional reform established in Gauteng the most industrialised province of South Africa around Johannesburg and Pretoria Our interest is to engage with the impact of SLPs on teachers given the frequent claims that teacher autonomy is seriously eroded and threatened by SLPs We examine the relationship between autonomy and authority by drawing on the philosophers Peters and Winch as well as on curriculum theorists Remillard Morris and Hiebert who have studied standardized curriculum materials and their impact on teachers work The paper argues for a deeper analytical understanding of teacher autonomy and offers three conditions that can equip teachers to seize autonomy opportunities when working with SLPsstandardised curriculum materials of high quality sufficiently specified so that correct and incorrect ways of following the content and procedures inscribed in the SLPs and the reasons for them are accessible to all teachersauthority which is considered legitimate applied in a morally justified manner and managed in an educationally sound way andappropriate use of professional and personal knowledge when making decisions and evaluating SLPs prescriptions in context In the rest of the paper we evaluate the autonomy opportunities provided by the GPLMS standardised lesson plans by examining whether the three conditions were metFor foreign language education in Vietnam passive teaching and learning with limited materials is thought to be associated with low achievement This paper discusses the design and implementation of an innovative approach to guide students to build a Fun Reading Corner in foreign language using an autonomousbased approach in a Vietnam university Survey data were collected before and after the project and from a focus groups writing samples The findings indicated that studentsattitudes towards reading in French changed and their personal qualities and skills improved during the course The paper concludes by explaining the significance of the results and implications for other Vietnamese foreign language programsThe article reports on the cultural representation matters in the field of education and how the school management should work to provide diversification in terms of recruiting teachers of various backgrounds including Latino teachers Topics discussed include Common Misconceptions which Hinder Latino Educators and Students and under representation of Latinos as students and as school administratorsDuring as near as three decades after the political changes in Slovakia its system of education has undergone many reforms As an integral part of them have been changes regarding school autonomy as it influences quality of education To achieve an optimal model of autonomy offered to schools is very difficult as appropriate level of autonomy is dependent on time and social conditions To improve democratic participation of primary and secondary school leaders in Slovakia a research aimed at assessment of the current state of the level of school autonomy was carried out The research data were obtained from a questionnaire survey the respondents of which wereheadmasters and deputy headmasters These school leaders assessed the power they the schools have in five fields namely in the fields of school activity in the whole school curricula matters school financing and budgeting staff recruitment selection employing and sacking administrative and operational management The assessment they give once with respect to the level in which to them given autonomy matches the tasks and problems they have to cope with and the second time with respect to their opinion where the scope of the autonomy should be changed Although the school leaders assessed the level of the powers they are given in a positive way as average or broader they still feel a need to have a broader scope of the powers and responsibilities mainly in the field of financing and budgetingWe examined the mediating role of psychological needs satisfaction in the association between goal content and subjective wellbeing SWB in a Chinese cultural context Chinese adolescents N completed the Aspiration Index the Basic Needs Satisfaction in General Scale and the Index of WellBeing The results suggested that SWB was positively correlated with intrinsic goals and psychological needs satisfaction and intrinsic goals were positively correlated with psychological needs satisfaction Mediation analysis revealed that psychological needs satisfaction partially mediated the association between intrinsic goals and SWB These results imply that pursuit of intrinsic goals helps individuals meet their psychological needs thus promoting SWB Together these results suggest that educators and parents can help Chinese adolescents enhance their SWB by encouraging them to form intrinsic life goals and satisfy their psychological needsPrompted by the poor state of mathematics education in South Africa and the shortage of competent mathematics teachers this study sought to identify what factors influencedPostgraduate Certificate in Education PGCE students at three universities in the Western Cape Province with Mathematics as a major subject to choose teaching as a career The respondents were asked to articulate reasons for their career choice by answering an openended question and completing an internationally validated FITchoice questionnaire The motivations presented in the questionnaire are based on the concepts of Selfefficacy Selfdetermination Theory SDT and Expectancy Value Theory EVT The research has shown that student responses regarding their motivations were remarkably consistent regardless of the respondents home language or social class Student rating choices were based mainly on intrinsic motivations The study concludes therefore that understanding student choices with respect to Mathematics teaching as a career will assist in the planning and management of the recruitment and retention of quality Mathematics teachers It is clear from this research that when student teachers with intrinsic motivation are identified and recruited they will be more likely to perceive teaching as a lifelong career choiceWe examine the impact of a flipped classroom model of learning on student performance and satisfaction in a large undergraduate introductory statistics class Two professors each taught a lecturesection and a flippedclass section Using MANCOVA a linear combination of final exam scores average quiz scores and course ratings was compared for the two groups after controlling for the effects of students previous achievement gender teacher degree of learner autonomy and attitudes about math and statistics The results show significant improvement in the students performance and course satisfaction with the flipped classroom Overall the results showed that the flipped classroom model can be used in large lecture classes with the help of undergraduate teaching assistants and the use of additional labsYoung childrens selfregulation and problemsolving skills are significant predictors of school success While early childhood educators shape the development of these skills providing effective and timely assistance can be challenging Drawing on complementary theories of Vygotsky Pekrun and Lerner this article chronicles the instructional approaches and strategies employed by one team of teachers to support preschool childrens solutions to complex functional and social problems in the classroom Findings from this narrative study highlight the focal teachers use of modeling mindful language and other proactive strategies to develop students problemsolving skills and foster independence In an age of resultsfocused education this article argues for the importance of cultivating intentional teacher pedagogies that build young childrens autonomy and efficacy by working through problems as opposed to seeking resolution only In so doing this study elucidates the value of these intuitive and often nuanced aspects of early childhood educators classroom practices PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedIn the present study we examine the bidirectional associations between child vocabulary and selfregulation and their interplay with two relational dimensions teacherchild closeness and autonomy support in preschool Participants wereyoung childrenboys M years andmonths SD from socially disadvantaged areas in Portugal Selfregulation and vocabulary were assessed at the beginning and end of the year Teachers reported on levels of teacherchild closeness and autonomy support A series of path analyses were conducted and tests of direct and indirect effects were included in the models Results showed bidirectional effects between selfregulation and vocabulary such that selfregulation at the beginning of preschool was a significant predictor of expressive vocabulary at the end of preschool year and receptive vocabulary skills at the beginning of preschool year predicted selfregulation at the end of preschool year controlling for earlier receptive vocabulary and selfregulation skills In addition teacherchild closeness uniquely predicted expressive vocabulary whereas teacher autonomy support uniquely predicted selfregulation PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedAn introduction is presented in which the editor discusses articles in the issue on topics including a debate between traditionalist and progressive educators about what is taught and how it is taught need of changes to the educational assessment and professional freedomBackground Inadequacy of authoritybased defensive teaching and summative and productbased evaluation such as certification and observation measures in providing information about the actual teaching teachers do was an inspiration in this study to design an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competences This study aimed at designing an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competencesMethods To this end teacher competences were theoretically defined and the indicators of competence in practice were derived and operationalized through Competency Framework for Teachers proposed by department of education and training in Australiaby a panel of five EFL English as a foreign language teaching experts through focused group discussion The resulting inventory wasitems on four teacher competences including critical clinical personal and technical competences from three perspectives of student departmental learning and growth measured onpoint likert scaleResults Testing the inventory withIranian EFL teachers indicated that there were high Cronbachs alpha reliability indices for the three main perspectives and their dimensions This implies that the inventory enjoyed appropriate internal consistency The results of exploratory factors analysis indicated that there was no construct irrelevant factor and all the indicators were loaded in the related teacher competence and perspective dimension Four separate structural equation models SEM were tested in order to probe the trait structure of the inventory The first three SEM models targeted the three perspectives individually while the last model explored the structure of the total data The results indicated that all items had significant contributions to their respective dimensionsConclusions The potential application of this inventory in teacher education programs and the factors that limit its applicability were discussedRecognizing that teachers motivating styles predict students classroom engagement we investigated whether students classroom engagement might predict a change in teachers motivating styles though we investigated only students perceptions of these changes Using a selfdetermination theory framework and a classroombased longitudinal research designPeruvian university students selfreported their teachers perceived autonomysupportive teaching and four aspects of their own engagement behavioral emotional agentic and cognitive at the beginning T and end T of a semester As expected earlysemester perceived autonomysupportive teaching predicted longitudinal increases in all four aspects of students latesemester engagement More importantly students earlysemester agentic engagement predicted longitudinal increases in perceived autonomysupportive teaching which suggests that students classroom engagement may recruit greater perceived autonomy support PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThis paper explores teachers and school leaders perceptions of commercialisation in Australian public schools reporting on findings from an openended survey question from an exploratory study that sought to investigate teacher and school leader perceptions and experiences of commercialisation Commercialisation for the purposes of this paper is understood as the creation marketing and sale of education goods and services to schools by forprofit providers and often includes but is not limited to the provision of curriculum content assessment services data infrastructures digital learning remedial instruction professional development and school administration support Our account highlights that commercialisation is prevalent in the daytoday practice of Australian public schools The perceptions of teachers and leaders suggest that commercialisation is complex with both affordances and challenges Respondents acknowledged that aspects of commercialisation are necessary for successfully running schools and classrooms in the st century but also noted that there is a fine line beyond which these seemingly innocuous services become perilous Concerns focused on how particular services are leading to the deprofessionalisation of teachers as they have less autonomy over what to teach and how to teach it Moreover teachers and school leaders reported being perturbed by the idea that commercial providers and services might work to replace teachers in the future Drawing on these data we argue that growing commercialisation in Australian public schools clearly requires an ethical debate that schools education professionals policy makers and interested publics are yet to haveThis paper introduces the teaching model for specialized translation introduced at Matej Bel University On one hand the model is based on the tradition of translation studies in Slovakia and former Czechoslovakia but on the other hand it takes into consideration the skills needed for the translation of specialized texts in contemporary working environments These skills are based on the competences proposed by the EMT network as well as on the latest Slovak research on the domestic translation market Inthe Translation and Interpreting Centre TaIC was established with the aim of enhancing the training of future translators and interpreters Through supervised practice the TaIC provides students with the opportunity to experience real working conditions in the field of translation and interpreting as well as providing teachers with the opportunity to assess their students performance A survey conducted among students and graduates who participated in the TaIC is analysed in the last part of this paper The paper describes the proposed model its advantages and disadvantages and its contribution to the translator and interpreter training programme at Matej Bel UniversityThe present study investigates whether productive classroom discourse in the form of instructional and

studying abroad for a semester in Denmark All students participated in a course focusing on children and adolescents in Scandinavian contexts a semesterlong practicum experience in a Danish educational institution and two courseembedded travel experiences within and outside of Denmark Although there were no significant differences in students pre and posttest scores on the Global Engagement Survey Hartman et alresponses to openended prompts provided evidence that students developed knowledge and understanding of themselves and others in multiple cultural and educational contexts They worked to make meaning of their observations throughout the semester and established strong relationships with the host community The practicum and study tour experiences provided ample opportunities for global learning many students reported that they gained knowledge about diversity and considered issues from the perspectives of local and global communitiesTeaching mixed ability classes is a challenge and a reality for both the novice and the experienced teacher worldwide Likewise preparing graduates for the work force in the st century entails teaching certain skills that reflect the specific demands that will be placed upon employees in a complex competitive knowledgebased technologydriven economysociety One of these skills is the ability to work collaboratively in teams This paper discusses an experience with an adult heterogeneous group based in Italy and suggests a practical approach that goes beyond the passive viewing of a film the use of a cooperative pedagogical framework that yielded positive motivating resultsThe main purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between English Foreign Language EFL teachers willingness and conformity with postmethod pedagogy and their teaching effectiveness The participants comprisedEFL teachers teaching andEFL learners studying at different language institutes in several cities of Iran Their selection was based on random sampling and the participation was entirely voluntary In this study two instruments were used post method questionnaire and Effective teaching questionnaire Pearsons correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling SEM were run to analyze the causal relationships among the components The results of Structural Equation Modeling demonstrated that effective teaching is positively and significantly predicted by all three subscales of postmethod teacher autonomy teacher sense of social justice and their sense of academic enthusiasm Also effective teaching is positively and significantly associated with total post method Furthermore effective teaching has the highest positive correlation with teacher enthusiasm and the lowest positive correlation with teacher autonomy Finally these findings were discussed with reference to the context of IranDynamics of policy making for education are invested with intersubjective tensions as different stakeholders seek to meet their changing needs in the shifting ground of neoliberalism Recent literature emphasising the need for boundarywork seeks to bridge the tensions in order to broker resolutions I argue that perspectives on boundarywork connecting with the Foucauldian sense of power as relations could benefit from further analysis of the forms of intersubjective conflict involved Accordingly Sartres concept of conflicted Otherness is in focus Through empirical investigation the stances taken by advisory policy makers and school senior management attempting to navigate directives for art education are theorised This original approach to such relational boundaries locates key issues in the field of policy studies It raises questions about the difficulties of aiming for effective collaboration in a climate of protectionist reactions to globalisation incentivised competition and the divisive minimisation of creativity in the curriculumAbstract The aim of the

students behavior and may lead students to accept and reproduce gender biases in other social contexts The aim of this study was to examine whether PE teachers in Greece adopt gender biases in teaching and learning favoring male students The sample of the study comprisedelementary n and secondary education students n attending typical coeducational schools in Greece M SD Participants completed the Perceived Physical Education Class Environment With Respect to the Achievement of Boys Questionnaire which the researchers used to assess students perceptions of gender inequalities during PE courses The results revealed that male secondary education students reported higher scores of negative behaviors toward them as compared to females as well as compared to students in elementary school The findings of this study provide valuable information on students beliefs about gender inequalities in PE courses that may stimulate future research in this areaBackground How teachers manage class learning and interact with students affects students motivation and engagement However it could be that the effect of students representation of teaching quality on the students motivation varies between classes Method Students fromclasses participated in the study We used multilevel random structural equation modeling to analyze whether the relationship of the students perception of teaching quality as an indicator of the students mental representation and students motivation varies between classes and if this variability depends on the class assessment of teaching quality as an indicator of teaching quality Results The effect of teachers structure on the regression slope of student perception of student competence wasThe effect of teachers autonomy support on the regression slope of student perception of student autonomy wasConclusions With this study we contribute a more detailed description of the relationship between teaching quality competence and autonomyBasic Psychological Needs Theory BPNT suggests that autonomysupportive teachers can promote the satisfaction of students three basic psychological needs ie the need for autonomy competence and relatedness and this is essential for optimal functioning and personal wellbeing The role of need satisfaction as a determinant of wellbeing is understood to be invariant across contexts and cultures The aim of this study is to test the invariance in the relationships between students perceptions of their teachers autonomy support and their psychological need satisfaction enjoyment concentration and boredom across different school subjects math English and physical education lessons and across different cultures England and TurkeyQuestionnaires tapping the targeted variables in the three different lesson types were completed by students in schools in England and Turkey Results from multilevel modeling analyses showed some support for the tenets of BPNT albeit there were inconsistences among the strengths of the hypothesized relationships based on country andor lesson typeAlthough a growing body of quantitative research has examined the noncognitive factors affecting the school engagement and performance of adolescents across cultures there is relatively sparse qualitative research investigating the perceptions of adolescents regarding the factors influencing their engagement and performance in school This focus group study comprisingIndian adolescents from India mean ageyears andIndian immigrant adolescents from Canada mean ageyears therefore using a selfdetermination theory perspective explored the perceptions of Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents about the factors affecting their school engagement and performance in India and Canada respectively Thematic analysis of eight focus group discussions suggested that Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents were primarily extrinsically motivated toward school and academics Further both the Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents perceived their classroom teachers as controlling rather than autonomysupportive Implications of the findings are briefly discussedThis study used a systemic perspective to examine a fivecomponent experiential process of perceptual and developmental growth and transfertoteaching Nineteen secondary math and science teachers participated in a yearlong engineering immersion and support experience with university faculty mentors Teachers identified critical shifts in perceptions of engineering and recognized appropriateness of engineering as

public such as the group of learners from tourism covered by our research Our proposal aims to analyze whether the virtual world of Second Life SL facilitates the development of English for Specific Purposes and the acquisition of intercultural communication To cover the objective qualitative and quantitative research were conducted along a fourphased inout SL instruction Questioning about the differences between the mean score obtained by experimental and control groups shows no significant differences in the acquisition of language regarding face to face and Second Life interaction but demonstrates a positive tendency in the case of intercultural competencesThis study intended to explore the relationship between middle school students engagement in mathematics classes and mathematics teachers motivational support Explanatory correlational research design was used for this purpose Participants were composed ofstudents attending th th and th grades in Alanya district of Antalya Province Effective Participation Scale and Teachers Motivational Support Scale were used in data collection The relationship between the datasets of middle school students engagement in mathematics classes and their perceptions regarding mathematics teachers motivational support was investigated via canonical correlation analysis Findings obtained showed that mathematics teachers autonomy support provided to middle school thth th grade students positively affected their behavioral engagement and emotional engagement It was also identified that mathematics teachers autonomy and relatedness support provided to middle school thth th grade students negatively affected their emotional disaffection towards mathematics classesWe explore the experiences of school science teachers as they enact three linked national curriculum and assessment policy reforms in Sweden Our goal is to understand teachers differing responses to these reforms A sample ofteachers engaged ininterviews over a month period Interviews included exploration of professional background and school context perceptions of the aims of the policy reforms and experiences of working with these reforms in the classroom Analysis was guided by an individualoriented sociocultural perspective on professional agency Here teaching is conceptualised as an ongoing interplay between teachers knowledge skills and personal goals and the characteristics of the social institutional and policy settings in which they work Our analysis shows that navigating the ensuing continuities and contradictions results in many different expressions of teacher agency eg loss of autonomy and trust pushing back subversion transfer of authority and creative tensions Typically an individual teachers enactment of these reforms involved several of these expressions of agency We demonstrate that the sociocultural perspective provides insights into teachers responses to education policy reform likely to be missed by studies that focus largely on individual teacher knowledgebeliefs about reform or skills in implementing reform practicesThroughout the past decade the Argentinean government has lowered the starting age of compulsory education and early childhood education enrollment has been growing steadily However ECE services have evolved in a fragmented manner leading to an unequal and inequitable scenario while private education supports the largest part of the growth children from lowincome families are less likely to attend preschool and more likely to receive lowquality service Through a newspaper coverage analysis I explore how these problems are addressed in the public debate on universal preschool Results show that the voices of policymakers and experts are prominent while teachers and parents views are ignored I found a widespread consensus for universal preschool and a scarcity of arguments against I suggest the need to draw on research findings in ECE more critically and posit that the need to ensure high quality preschool for all children should be central in the debateThis article describes experiences formed in connection with a case study in Smi schools The Smi people live in the northern part of the North Calotte region and among the worlds Indigenous peoples The development of culturebased education aims to diminish the dominance of the national curricula The aim of this article is to understand factors that influence teachers views and how teachers experience culturebased education in terms of a decolonizing process The case study was conducted in a Critical Utopian Action Research framework with future workshops The future workshops began as collaborative selfcriticism and dreaming of education and then moved to the implementation of Indigenous culturebased teaching activities in local teaching practices The teachers expressed that they felt trapped between demands made by the national curricula and their desire to implement culturebased teaching but they nevertheless had many ideas for themes via which culture could be linked to teaching Through knowledge exchange between the participants in the case study the teachers rediscovered knowledge and reinterpreted that knowledge in a teaching setting The teachers autonomy was strengthened and the teachers active efforts empowered themProjectbased learning is a teaching approach that continues to gain traction in high schools and universities This approach allows students to create and complete projects that are relevant and meaningful to them Projects should be complex enough so that students undergo a series of trial and error episodes which allows them to learn important life skills such as problemsolving and creativity This approach is helping change the status quo in education because rigor is not based on the ability to memorize information for tests but instead focuses on a more meaningful learning theory that includes testing ideas against reality to determine their worth This article addresses research studies that support the projectbased learning process but it also provides examples of how graduates from a university in Minnesota have implemented this approach to improve professional practiceThe ability to employ the language as a communicational tool often serves as a measure of ones speaking success in the language learning class This research sought to investigate the effect of learners autonomous textbook selection on the speaking ability of Iranian English as foreign language EFL learners Moreover finding and analyzing factors considered by the learners in selecting the textbooks were another aim of this research Sixty Iranian intermediate EFL learners from the Simin Language Institute in Ramsar Mazandaran Iran were selected as the participants of the study based on their scores on Oxford Placement Test This test determines the level of the students English proficiency These participants were randomly assigned into the control and experimental groups An interview procedure was run as their pretest The experimental group studied from their selected books besides the researchers teaching in the class Aftersessions a posttest the same as the pretest was run as well The quantitative results indicated the superior performance of the experimental group over the control group Furthermore an analysis of the xrefLitzs xref questionnaire shows that learners considered criteria such as practical considerations layout and design activities skills language type subject and content of the selected booksBu alma retmenlerin

of information technology and policies encouraging interactivities in teaching and learning the use of students response system SRS commonly known as clickers has experienced substantial growth in recent years The reported effectiveness of SRS has varied Based on the framework of technologicalpedagogicalcontent knowledge TPACK the current study attempted to explore the disparity in efficiency of adopting SRS A concurrent mixed method design was adopted to delineate factors conducive to efficient adoption of SRS through closedended survey responses and qualitative data Participants were purposefully sampled from diverse academic disciplines and backgrounds Seventeen teachers from various disciplines ie tourism management business health sciences applied sciences engineering and social sciences at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University formed a teacher focus group for the current study In the facilitated focus group issues relating to efficient use of clickers participants explored questions on teachers knowledge on various technologies knowledge relating to their subject matters methods and processes of teaching as well as how to integrate all knowledge into their teaching The TPACK model was adopted to guide the discussions Emergent themes from the discussions were extracted using NVivofor Windows and were categorized according to the framework of TPACK The survey implemented on an online survey platform solicited participants on teachers knowledge and technology acceptance The closeended survey compriseditems based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge TPACK framework anditems based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology UTAUT Participating teachers concurred with the suggestion that use of clickers is instrumental in engaging students in learning and assessing formative students progress Converging with the survey results several major themes contributing to the successful implementation of clickers namely technology technologicalpedagogical technologicalcontent technologicalpedagogicalcontent knowledge were identified from the teacher focus groups The most and second most frequently cited themes were technologicalpedagogicalcontent Knowledge and the technological knowledge respectively Findings from the current study triangulated with previous findings on TPACK and use of clickers particularly the influence of technologicalpedagogicalcontent Knowledge and technological knowledge on successful integration of innovations in class Furthermore the current study highlighted the impact of technologicalpedagogical and technologicalcontent knowledge for further research to unfold technology adoption with these featured TPACK configurations as well as rendering support to frontline academics related to integration of technology and pedagogyCurriculum integration is one of the concepts which has been discussed for years Telecollaborative projects which employ elements of distance learning provide opportunities for putting the idea into practice Analysis of eTwinning projects undertaken in Polish schools aims at demonstrating the integrative role of distance learning approaches and their contribution to integration of various themes in educational context As the eTwinning framework is very flexible allowing for teacher and students autonomy the projects may vary in the topics age and number of participants duration scope within curriculum etc The study shows various levels and perspectives of curriculum integration which take place in eTwinning projects It also discusses the role of distance learning at primary and secondary educational levels The challenge is to transform international collaboration of selected schools an everyday practice for all learners and teachersThe article offers advice for school administrators on energizing and engaging teachers in their work Topics include the notion of buyin in relation to organizational goals the need for teacher autonomy in relation to professional development and the creation of learning communities for teachersPurpose Academic researchers have reported that the climate of a school deeply affects students and other partners A safe and caring school environment is one in which school attendees feel respected feel that their work is meaningful and feel that they are good at what they do The purpose of this paper was to determine how teachers perceived the school climate that shaped learning processes and personal development in Kutahya and how principals and other dimensions affect the teachers perceptions Research Methods This study employed a qualitative methodology to measure the school climate A semistructured interview technique was used asking openended questions to obtain clear data from participants The data were analyzed using data codes applied to the text Findings The study found the school climate to be gloomy in Kutahya Teachers were dealing with excessive paperwork and supererogatory regulations in their schools They were unable to produce new ideas even though they were experienced in their profession Some principals were favoritist and applied their patronage according to their personal relationship with the teachers Some teachers were closed to new creative ideas at school and did not want to exert any extra effort for their school Implications for Research and Practice The results emphasized that a positive school climate is crucial for the school to attain their ontological existence which is raising competent capable students A positive school climate requires an open healthy school ethos that fosters a sense of responsibility and efficacy between teachers and school administrators Future studies could elaborate social studies with other disciplines to improve the learning climate in schoolsAbstract Finnish students international success in mathematics has been largely explained by the highquality compulsory basic education system while increasing evidence suggests that early childhood contexts can also promote development long before formal instruction begins This study examined in a sample ofmotherinfant dyadsearly contextual precursors of later mathematical development at preschool age and at the end of comprehensive school The path analyses showed that maternal autonomy support and scaffolding observed during joint play interactions in infancy and time spent in various care contexts beyond infancy contributed more to variation in numerical skills than spatial skills tested at preschool age Maternal autonomy supportive behaviours were related to differences in mathematics and other school grades collected in ninth grade even after controlling for time spent in various care contexts Moreover joint play interactions mediated the relation between mothers education and childrens mathematical outcomes The findings are discussed in relation to why early developmental contexts can provide an advantageous base for childrens mathematical achievement in a society with a highquality education system Highlights Does the quality of motherinfant interaction and amount of early childhood education and care beyond infancy predict childrens mathematical development Mothers cognitive guidance observed during play predicted childrens mathematics skills tested at preschool and assessed by teachers at th grade Autonomy support and scaffolding in early developmental contexts can have farreaching influences on childrens motivation and school achievementPurpose Instructional leadership has been an active area of educational administration research over the pastyears However there has been significant divergence in how instructional leadership has been conceptualized over time The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review ofyears of quantitative instructional leadership research up throughusing a nationally generalizable data setDesignmethodologyapproach The authors conducted a metanarrative review ofstudies that investigated at least one aspect of instructional leadership using the Schools and Staffing Survey SASS administered by the US National Center for Education StatisticsFindings There were four major themes of instructional leadership research that analyzed SASS data principal leadership and influence teacher autonomy and influence adult development and school climate The three factors most researched in relationship to instructional leadership themes were teacher satisfaction teacher commitment and teacher retention This study details the major findings within each theme describes the relationships between all seven factors and integrates the relationships into a single modelOriginalityvalue This paper provides the most comprehensive literature review todate of quantitative findings investigating instructional leadership from the same nationally generalizable data set This paper provides evidence that leadership for learning is the conceptual evolution ofyears of diverse instructional leadership researchThe quality of the teaching process in visual arts largely depends on a creative and effective combination of both general and subjectspecific visual arts teaching methods The aim of this study was to determine inservice teachers perceptions of the features specifics importance and objectives of teaching methods in visual arts education as well as their perception of the importance of visual arts as a school subject The research was conducted on a sample ofCroatian elementary school teachers A correlation was determined between the following variables teachers work experience teachers perception of the importance of visual arts education and the variable use of teaching methods in visual arts classes Findings have implications for modernizing and improving school practice they also suggest further research in this areaThe aim of the present quasiexperimental study is to investigate the effect of dialogue journal assessment and portfolio assessment on Iranian EFL learners writing performance To do thisintermediate EFL students fromstudents in OmidMofid English Language institute in Khoy were nonrandomly chosen They were male and femalefemales andmales and their age range is betweenThen they were randomly divided into three groups ofa control group receiving only the routine instruction and two experimental groups receiving portfolio and dialogue journal respectively Topic based paragraph writing as pretest and posttest were given to the participants of three groups to detect their writing ability at the beginning and at end of study The result of the study showed that portfolio assessment group the dialogue journal group and the control group performed significantly different on the post test Students in portfolio assessment group outperformed than the student in dialogue journal group and performance of dialogue journal group was better than control group in their writing performance Finally some implications are provided for EFL teachers learners and syllabus designersThis article briefly examines and explains the theory of social ecology and the political theory of libertarian municipalism as developed by the late Murray Bookchinas a possible comprehensive framework for a secondary curriculum centered upon an anarchistic and ecological ethics The author first offers an investigation of the philosophical foundations of social ecology and the political theory of libertarian municipalism and their implications for how we think about and practice education Next the author shares findings from an empirical study conducted at a small charter high school in a large metropolitan area that utilizes social ecology and communitybased education to move its students toward enhanced selfactualization through active participation in nurturing greater community autonomy and in addressing social and environmental injustice The aim of sharing these findings is to provide insight into how social ecology is understood and used by teachers and students within a school to foster social and ecological responsibility and activism on the community levelThis article examines the role of research and development within Englands school system From a range of literature past and present we argue that six features three dimensions should form the focus for action at the institutional systemic and policy levels Applying these stress tests to the current system we suggest that an effective ecosystem of researchinformed schools is as yet not being fully realized We argue that the keys to improving this are to change the structures cultures and incentives that bridge the researchpractice divide and to align accountability arrangements to allow schools to learn through enquiryAlthough entrepreneurship has become a movement in arts career preparation programs its application for schoolbased music educators remains unclear This article suggests that intrapreneuringentrepreneurial practice within large organizationsbetter encapsulates the balance of innovation and affiliation that teachers often pursue to enhance their motivation at work Results from a survey of K music educators suggest that intrapreneurial mindsets and behaviors predict higher fulfillment of teachers needs for autonomy competence and relatednessall elements crucial to healthy motivation For many music educators intrapreneuring may serve as an ideal pathway to increased motivation career longevity and a broader teacherdriven approach to education reformThis article reviews the literature of student engagement as it is defined for K and higher education settings This article first identifies the various definitions of engagement and then describes the reasons for growing practitioner and academic interest to increase student engagement The article concludes with a review of some studies of student engagement engagement practices that improve student learning and a review of a national test used to measure engagement levels at institutions of higher educationIntroduction The problem of the article is addressed to clarify the question of how the content of practical pedagogical knowledge accumulated by the society can be understood from the point of view of an epistemologically correct theoretical scheme to what extent this scheme itself is now formed in the methodology of pedagogy and what are the immediate prospects for such formation The aim of the article is to reveal the epistemological coding of the modern state of educational theory as an object of research reflection and the prospects for its further formation Materials and Methods Among our research methods we consider it possible to include analysis of literature on the topic of the work a theoretical substantive generalization heuristic synthesis the formulation of a hypothesis about the possible content and activity filling the field of reflection of researchers in the field of pedagogy and a prospectus of further approaches to the study of the problem Results The modern initial stage of the theoretical interpretation of pedagogy is identified the difficulties of which are explained by the polyphony of coding the object of pedagogy its fundamental foundations the rules for deducing consequences from general provisions the correct implementation of generalizations and analogies and the methods for carrying out the experiment and identifying experimental confirmation of an experted theory As the nearest stage in the solution of these problems the authors design correct theoretical constructs of a restricted nature which must include the following aspects identifying weak research development of several segments of pedagogical reality raising hypotheses about the possibility of describing them from the point of view of the positively valuable educational outcome for the learner and the ways of achieving it finding the criteria for its evaluation and implementing them in a diagnostic format Conclusions The presented variant of polyaspect reflection of the results of educational research based on the theoretical scheme covers both retrospective and prospective reflective forms it also shows all the procedures traditionally indicated by psychologists stopping removing fixing reviewing objectifying allows educational researchers to evaluate their investigations according to scientific norms which achieve a theoretical status All the theses of the problematic format presented in the article are a possible field of application for beginning researchersThe article examines the benefits that can be provided by educational tests and measurements focusing on how teachers can best test their students It examines how assessments can improve learning during each lessons keep educators and students focused on academic goals and emphasize student results as the objectives of instructionBackgroundBoth education policies and curriculum documents identify the personal development of students as a key objective of modern education Physical education PE in particular has been cited as a subject that can promote students life skills development and psychological wellbeing However little research has investigated the processes by which PE may be related to students development of life skills and their psychological wellbeing PurposeUsing Benson and SaitosThe Scientific Foundations of Youth Development InTrends inYouth Development Visions Realities and Challenges edited by PLBenson and KJPittmanNorwell MA Kluwer Academic framework for youth development theory and research this study explored the relationships between the teaching climate students perceived life skills development within PE and their psychological wellbeing Participants and settingParticipants wereBritish PE students Mage range years attendingsecondary schools in Scotland and England On average these male n and female n students took part in PE classes forhours per week Data collectionThe data were collected via a survey which assessed perceived

and participants psychological wellbeing ConclusionThe findings suggest that perceived teacher autonomy support along with total life skills development is related to participants psychological wellbeing Interpretation of the results suggests that PE teachers should integrate autonomy supportive behaviours into their teaching eg provide choice in activities and encourage students to ask questions as they are associated with young peoples development of multiple life skills and their psychological wellbeingThe article offers information on National Council on Teacher Quality NCTQ and elementary literacy instruction and mentions role of NCTQ in providing an alternative national voice to existing teacher organizations and NCTQs perspectives on teacher preparationAn introduction is presented in which the editor discusses articles in the issue on topics including Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol SIOP information on target audience for SIOP and teachers autonomyThe author reports on her role in contributing to build the school community by encouraging professional collaboration among teachers after accepting a teaching position at a newly formed elementary school in an urban area of northern California She says that she had the experience of six years of teaching and working as an administrator in an early childhood education settingObjectives Grounded in selfdetermination theorys dualprocess model we implemented an autonomysupportive intervention program ASIP to help physical education PE teachers become more autonomysupportive and less controlling toward their students We tested whether such changes in teachers classroom motivating styles could promote students prosocial behaviors and diminish their antisocial behaviors Design We used an experimental research design to manipulate teachers motivating style and a threewave longitudinal design to assess the studentreported dependent measures Method We randomly assigned secondarygrade PE teacherswomenmen to participate or not in the ASIP At midsemester classroom observers rated teachers autonomysupportive and controlling instructional behaviors At the end of the semester teachers rated their students prosocial and antisocial behaviors At the beginning middle and end of the semester thestudents of these teachers completed measures of need satisfaction need frustration prosocial behavior and antisocial behavior Results ASIP participation increased teachers autonomy support and students need satisfaction and prosocial behavior and it decreased teachers control and students need frustration antisocial behavior and attitude toward cheating Multilevel structural equation modeling showed that longitudinal increases in prosocial behavior were mostly a function of need satisfaction gains while longitudinally decreases in antisocial behavior and acceptance of cheating were mostly a function of need frustration declines Conclusion ASIPenabled benefits extend beyond previouslydocumented student personal functioning gains eg engagement to include student social functioning gains as well PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedWhile teacher professionalism remains a contested topic scholars increasingly acknowledge the field has entered a new professionalism wherein its parameters are dictated by management and the organization rather than those within the occupation Many argue that this shift has served to decrease teachers sense of professionali sm efficacy and persistence Simultaneously noexcuses charter schools considered to embrace this new professionalism continue to proliferate Yet little is known about how teachers within these schools view teaching and the qualities of teacher profes sionalism To address this gap we interviewed twenty new and novice teachers teaching in high profile charter organizations in the northeast such as Uncommon Schools KIPP MATCH and Boston Collegiate Our findings suggest that these teachers largely perceived their schools and the degree of professionalism positively For example teachers reported that their schools fostered teacher autonomy professional accountability and collaboration However their schools highaccountability climates encouraged feelings of competition and caused teachers to question their efficacy ultimately reinforcing views of teaching as a shortterm endeavor Finally professional status and rewards were described as low with many teachers saying they felt underappreciated or undervalued Our findings demonstrate how the climate of new professionalism can produce outcomes both consistent and in tension with efforts to professionalize teachingThe aim of this study is to examine the impact of classlevel class climate on schoolaged childrens life satisfaction Data was derived from the German National Educational Panel Study NEPS using sixth grade schoolaged children nclasses Class climate includes indicators of teachers care and monitoring demands interaction autonomy as well as schoolaged childrens attitudes towards schoolwork at the class and individuallevel Results showed that individual perceived class climate in terms of teachers care and monitoring and autonomy was positively related to life satisfaction whereas schoolrelated demands were related to lower life satisfaction Besides teachers care and monitoring at classlevel indicators of class climate were not associated with schoolaged childrens life satisfaction while the individual perceived class climate is more important for life satisfactionObjective To explore the changes in motivation of Dutch pharmacists for Continuing Education CE in the Dutch CE system Methods Pharmacists motivation was measured across three time points with the Academic Motivation Scale based on the SelfDetermination Theory of motivation The Latent Growth Modelling technique was used to analyze these data Results Over a period ofmonths Controlled Motivation had increased and Relative Autonomous Motivation of Dutch pharmacists had decreased Traineeship was the only demographic factor with a significant influence on the change in motivation No subgroups with different trajectories could be identified Conclusion Relative Autonomous Motivation of Dutch pharmacists for CE decreases over time This indicates a loss of Autonomous Motivation good motivation in favor of Controlled Motivation bad motivation Further research needs to be conducted to gain a better understanding of the association between pharmacist motivation and the features of the current CE systemThe present study examined indirect effects of principal leadership on the mathematics achievement ofyearold students fromschools inOECD economies Results showed that the students could be divided into three categories DisadvantagedAverage andPrivileged differing in levels of student SES and prior achievement parental academic expectations and access to school resources Results also showed that principal leadership effects accounted for a greater proportion of betweenschool achievement variance forDisadvantagedvisvisPrivilegedorAveragestudents In particular instructional leadership had the largest positive effect onDisadvantagedvisvis other students achievement via the mediating variables of teacher autonomy and morale Distributed leadership negatively affected the achievement ofDisadvantagedbut not other students The negative effects of principal goalsetting were the largest while those of principal problemsolving were the smallest forDisadvantagedstudents The study contributes to the literature by examining contextual influences on the leadershipachievement relationshipThis paper reports the main findings of a study that sought to understand how teachers and department heads perceived and experienced the implementation of a classroom observation system in a teacher evaluation context The data was collected through a teacher and department head survey and interviews with department heads who were responsible for classroom observation The findings show that respondents regarded classroom observation as an inadequate teacher evaluation instrument It was also viewed as one of the features of the teacher evaluation system that least contributed to the teachers professional development Department heads felt torn between their intermediate management role as teacher observers and their professional role as teacher peers Cultural norms of individual professional autonomy that regulated relations among colleagues prevented department heads from using information gathered through classroom observation to nourish indepth professional discussions about concrete educational practicesJohn R Troutman McCrann a math educator and teacher leader at Harvest Collegiate High School in New York City writes that teachers autonomy to design and assess student learning has been siphoned away In this article he makes an argument for why assessment should be left in the hands of those who know students and standards bestteachersand provides recommendations to school leaders to implement meaningful teachercreated performance assessmentsThis paper explores the design development and evaluation of an early childhood literacy iPad application focusing on the English Alphabet called A to Z Safari trialled in Australian classrooms A to Z Safari was designed to assist students in the early years of schooling with learning the alphabet and building on their knowledge of lettersounds This paper details the process that led to the design and development of A to Z Safari and evaluates the success of the application also known as app using the Technology Acceptance Model TAM from a classroom trial inQuantitative data from the app statistics gathered on student use and qualitative interviews with classroom teachers explores how students and teachers received A to Z Safari It was found that the design of A to Z Safari exhibited ease of use and usefulness for the target cohort in regards to gameplay and teacher support however a number of updates need to be made to the apps functionality to satisfy future larger scale use Suggestions for those designing similar apps for use in classroom environments have been providedThe purpose of this study is to identify the views of teachers on teacher guidebooks and to analyse these views on the basis of the deskilling process The data were collected fromteachers through an openended questionnaire and analysed using content analysis method Results showed that although most of the teachers considered the guidebooks necessary they also made a number of criticisms Among these there were criticisms indicating that the guidebooks hindered teacher autonomy in various ways Teachers views and criticisms in this direction confirm that guidebooks have an important role in the deskilling process of teachersEven in this Age of Data independent progressive schools have shown a remarkable persistence in offering an alternative educational model As Traditional Public Schools TPS become even more committed to a testing model of achievement there are schools that continue to operate on identified progressive educational principles This paper uses observations and interviews at two upstate New York progressive schools to identify characteristics that define the resiliency of such institutions The authors findings identify four characteristics common to a progressive educational culture familial grouping informality play and democracy Four elements that are important to this progressive model of instruction tied to the culture at these schools are present individualized childcentered instruction curricular flexibility and choicespacetime the nature of and future for noninstitutional schools is also considered hereThe effects of Multiple Autonomy Support MAS meaning the autonomy support provided by two or more sources is an overlooked topic in social development literature The aim of this study is to understand how two types of MAS Total Multiple Autonomy Support TMAS and Multiple Autonomy Support Attunement MASA are related to early adolescents social development indicators prosocial behavior selfregulation antisocial behavior alcohol use and year substance use intention TMAS pertains to the general amount of autonomy support perceived by a MAS

must have opportunities to observe and practice critical thinking in the classroom In this parallel mixed method classroom study we investigate the role of collaborative concept mapping in the development of kindergarten learners critical thinking skills of analysis and interpretation over a five week period Learners had two large group experiences and three dyad experiences of collaborative concept mapping Results showed significant increases in critical thinking skills in the five week period when learners engaged in collaborative concept mapping supported by mentorship discussion and reallife scenarios We propose collaborative concept mapping as an instructional strategy to develop critical thinking skills in the kindergarten classroom Implications for future research and practice are discussedWe sought to identify teachers personalitybased antecedents that tend them toward an autonomysupportive or controlling motivating style We assessed both aspects of teachers motivating styles at the beginning of the semester T Timeand again after all teachers had completed a semesterlong intervention T to learn how to become more autonomy supportive and less controlling At the start of the semesterfulltime elementarygrade teachersfemalesmales completed a packet of questionnaires to selfreport their core traits the big five and eight surface traits eg causality orientations authoritarianism that we hypothesized would predict one motivating style or the other while theirstudents selfreported their autonomous motivation Regressionbased analyses revealed four findingsHigh levels of openness to experience and agreeableness both individually predicted teachers T autonomysupportive motivating stylehigh levels of control causality orientation and authoritarianism both individually predicted T controlling motivating stylehigh levels of autonomy causality orientation and personal growth initiative both individually predicted a postintervention change in T autonomysupportive motivating style andhigh level of control causality orientation predicted a postintervention change in T controlling motivating style These findings suggest a robust relation between personality and teachers motivating stylesTrips to extracurricular settings can foster exploration and may promote selfdetermined learning Students motivation is an essential characteristic of selfdetermined and successful learning processes in extracurricular settings The SelfDetermination Theory argues that the quality of students motivation is inter alia dependent on the fulfillment of the basic need for competence Extracurricular settings are potentially unstructured and may therefore frustrate students perception of competence Teachers tend to show restrictive behavior and use teacherled and taskoriented instructions in nonformal settings These findings were used to design a typical situation in an extracurricular setting We hypothesized that the provision of supplementary structure improves students quality of motivation by supporting their need for competence In our st studystudentsM ageSD ageR agevisited an exhibition dealing with locomotor systems Two degrees of structure were implemented basic and supplementary structure Students motivation was assessed at the end of the visit The results of studydid not show the assumed positive effect of supplementary structure on students motivation By closely analyzing our study design we suspected that the implemented teacher behavior in extracurricular settings might not have been appropriate Consequently we conducted a nd studyNM ageSD ageR agethat again examined the effect of two degrees of structure on students quality of motivation This time we implemented autonomysupportive teacher behaviors Otherwise the study was conducted identically In studywe found beneficial effects of supplementary structure on students motivation Comparing both studies additional structure showed only positive effects on students motivation when teachers acted autonomysupportivelyThe article offers information on the Learning Forwards Annual Conference in Orlando Florida in Decembercohosted by Learning Forward the National Center on Education and the Economy and the Lastinger Center at the University of Florida Topics discussed include continuous improvement of organization and commitment of educators to learning advancing the development of a learning profession and continuous learning for studentsThe study is based on selfdetermination theory and focuses on the motivation of highachieving Bedouin students who belong to a hierarchicalcollectivist society The study focuses on the question What are the relations between teachers autonomy support and control and an optimal learning experience among students The study is unique in its population and in the distinction it draws between two types of teachers control autonomy suppression explicit control and conditional negative regard a phenomenon examined for the first time in teachers implicit psychological control The study population consisted ofstudents from seven high schoolsgirls who completed questionnaires at two timepoints Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that perceived need satisfaction was positively predicted by teachers autonomy support and negatively predicted by teachers conditional negative regard while perception of a teacher as autonomy suppressive contributed directly and negatively to autonomous motivation In turn psychological need satisfaction positively predicted autonomous motivation in learning that in turn predicted positive emotions and engagement in learning The hypothesized mediation model has a good fit with the data The findings have implications concerning the optimal conditions for learning among Bedouin students in general and highachieving students in particular and concerning the importance of autonomysupportive teaching and refraining from control explicit and implicit alikeThe article discusses the notion of kinship in several young adult YA novels in relation to their use as teaching resources Books described include Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs Whale Talk by Chris Crutcher and All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely The notions of a sense of community and connecting with people are notedThe tenets of selfdetermination theory as applied to support were tested with structural equation modelling forpeople with ID with a mild to borderline level of functioning The results showed that a perceived autonomy support was positively associated with autonomous motivation and with satisfaction of need for autonomy relatedness and competence b autonomous motivation and need satisfaction were associated with higher psychological wellbeing c autonomous motivation and need satisfaction statistically mediated the association between autonomy support and wellbeing and d satisfaction of need for autonomy and relatedness was negatively associated with controlled motivation whereas satisfaction of need for relatedness was positively associated with autonomous motivation The selfdetermination theory provides insights relevant for improving support for people with intellectual disabilityIncreasingly prescribed teacher standards dictate what graduates will know and be able to do yet little heed is taken of how they learn In light of this situation a twophased study was undertaken Based on Rasch analysis of initial efficacy scalesintern teachers were interviewed The data was analysed using NVivo and LEARnT an a priori framework developed by the author This article reports on one case from the qualitative study of intern teachers in rural schools Autonomy and critical reflection were significant to transformative learning Contrary to the literature authenticity was a more significant source of efficacy than those previously understood including mastery experience social modeling vicarious experience social persuasion and psychological responses Implications exist for academic coursework and professional experience supervision that serve as accreditation frameworksThe professionalisation of teaching in Australia is a policy shift that transpires within broader policy dynamics which are increasingly influenced by neoliberal logics In this article we examine teacher responsibility through analysis of a new measure introduced in Victoria This requires teachers to prove professional development hours in the area of teaching students with special needs in order to maintain their professional registration Through our analysis of this policy move we draw out some tensions that emerge in relation to teacher responsibility accountability and autonomy to reveal that often hidden neoliberal governing logics can operate to shift teachers focus from care of the student towards care of the professional self With the theoretical support of Nel Noddings ethic of care we argue that teacher responsibility to care can be torn between marketbased regulations and the care of the student paradoxically deprofessionalising teachers work in the act of attempting to professionaliseIn an era of globalisation Springwellbeing no longer can be explored within ones own national borders but necessitates cultivating shared international understandings to maintain healthy twentyfirstcentury classrooms This literature review across Chinese and English international publications contends that understanding wellbeing entails more thoughtful global discussions examining wellness as apersonal commodityandshared societal experience This paper initiates explorations of teacher wellbeing as anindividualandcollectivephenomenon that includes teacher autonomy goal orientation professional efficacy personal healthandpositive collegial relationships institutional recognitionsupport and professional development opportunities This review suggests teachers in Western and Chinese contexts may benefit from unique forms of support to balance and reconcile individual and collective aspects of teacher wellbeing Teachers across contexts must have professional opportunity and incentives for engaging in autonomous practice supported by professional collaboration and developmentPublic school districts are facing twin challenges maintaining a labor supply of qualified teachers while shoring up the deteriorating system that compensates them Keeping publicschool teachers pensions plans flush is expensive and it accounts for a growing share of education spending In some states public charter schools provide an important alternative charters have the flexibility to opt out of the state pension plan and develop their own retirement plans The charter sectors in these states have the opportunity to serve as laboratories of innovation not only in terms of educational programs but also as examples of management strategies that could be applied to the broader teacher labor market To explore this possibility the authors studied retirement plans and surveyed charter schools in five states with such flexibility Arizona California Florida Louisiana and Michigan They found a growing number of schools especially those run by management organizations are choosing to opt out of state pension plans In lieu of standard plans charters are providing various more portable definedcontribution options and incentives such as k and b plans potentially providing a new way to ensure that teachers retirements are secure The autonomy provided to charter schools positions them to lead by example on this and other important issuesTo meet the demands of knowledge economy educational systems worldwide have developed many accountability mechanisms to hold the schools responsible for a standardized teaching and accountgiving for the results Henceforth this research seeks to portray the accountability pressures on schools and school responses and their variations between the groups of individual and institutional variables in Turkish context A survey research design investigated the data obtained by the Accountability Pressures Scale and Accountability Responses Scale from the stratified sample of K schools in Ktahya Turkey It revealed that teachers feel very less pressure from school shareholders school social environment and upper bureaucracy and they feel responsible only to the upper bureaucracy and supervisors The level of accountability relations variates between the subgroups of teacher characteristics such as school level gender position union membership and education level of teachers have an impact onAutonomy is one of the most prominent notions in general educational discourses and in L research Yet debates about learner autonomy in the field of foreignsecond language learning and teaching rarely take into consideration general eduational discourses of autonomy many of which focus critically on the modernist ideal of the sovereign autonomous subject This article argues that the critique of autonomy voiced in educational philosophy can contribute to a more differentiated understanding of the notion of autonomy in foreignsecond language learning It gives an overview of autonomy discourses in both fields and highlights some of the commonalities and differences In conclusion it is argued that a more sophisticated concept of autonomy is pivotal if one wants to realistically assess the degree and the kind of independence learners of languages can develop in the context of institutionalized learning and avoid an unreflected idealization as well as an unreflected rejection of autonomyWe designed a professional development PD teachermentor program that used problembased learning PBL to accomplish two goals First teachers explored how PBL could be used effectively in their classrooms to change the way they think about teaching to include literacy development in content areas Second PBL was the basis for PD training to help them improve their own knowledge of PBL become mentors to other teachers and implement PBL in their schools across content areas Educators in the United States are challenged to teach linguistically and culturally diverse LCD students with differing literacy levels The demographics of US classrooms require a rigorous attempt to engage LCD students through collaborative active learning opportunities McGroartyUS Department of EducationResearch shows that literacy learning for all students improves in classroom settings that take a cooperative studentcentered approach McGroarty NCSSShumway Saunders StewardsonReevePBL provides opportunities for students to engage in active learning and allows students with multiple learning styles to negotiate contextualized meaning through a variety of collaborative tasks PBL has also been shown to be an effective method for teaching learners to be selfdirected problemsolvers However in the absence of PD and ongoing support teachers are often resistant to the implementation of PBL In our program we used PBL to help teachers learn more about literacy and PBL while providing opportunities for PD and support As a result the teacher reflections discussions presentations and selfevaluations demonstrated how by using PBL in their classrooms while immersing themselves in evidencebased content they observed enhanced student collaboration Teachers felt that they were better able to foster a learning environment in their classrooms that would allow students to develop literacy skills in a contentrich context both because of the incorporation of PBL and because of the support they provided for each other This idea can be easily adapted to foster teacher development and mentoring programs in other fieldsPurpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of autonomy workload and worklife balance on job performance among teachers A survey was carried out among teachers in public schools in the Northern Region of Peninsular MalaysiaDesignmethodologyapproach This study adopted a quantitative approach to address the research objectives A total ofteachers reported on their level of autonomy workload and worklife balance as well as job performance Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences versionand Partial Least Square Smart PLS version Findings Based on the statistical analyses conducted the findings reported that autonomy and worklife balance had a significant impact on respondents job performance Workload on the other hand had no substantial bearing on job performance among school teachers in this studyPractical implications In terms of practical ramifications the management of schools need to focus on measures to enhance autonomy and worklife balance in improving job performance among teachers Finally directions for future research and conclusion of the study are also presentedOriginalityvalue Discussions emphasized on the importance of worklife balance and autonomy in elevating job performance among teachers This study also provided partial support to the Border and Boundary TheoryThe purpose of this study is to identify the views of teachers on teacher guidebooks and to analyse these views on the basis of the deskilling process The data were collected fromteachers through an openended questionnaire and analysed using content analysis method Results showed that although most of the teachers considered the guidebooks necessary they also made a number of criticisms Among these there were criticisms indicating that the guidebooks hindered teacher autonomy in various ways Teachers views and criticisms in this direction confirm that guidebooks have an important role in the deskilling process of teachersThe global population of students pursuing studies abroad continues to grow and consequently their intercultural experiences are receiving greater research attention However research into longterm student sojourners academic development and personal growth is still in its infancy A parallel mixed method study was designed to investigate the academic adjustment of international Chinese students who had studied in the UK for more than three years Using interview data collected from both Chinese students and British teachers and questionnaire data collected from a wider sample of the Chinese students the researcher examined the relationship between their academic psychological and social adjustment and provided a more holistic view of Chinese students intercultural adaptation process The results showed that the big challenge for the Chinese students during their early adjustment was to deal with the different perceptions of teaching and learning within their own culture and within the culture of their host country Changes were found in their language ability learning approaches and sense of self over time In particular social support and their agency as a learner played an important role in their academic developmentTeachers competence in launching and managing pedagogical change collaboratively is crucial for the continuous development of their work as well as for meaningful student learning However research on how teachers can thrive in their profession in the changing higher education environment is limited This study investigated the experiences of teachers in managing pedagogical innovation when working as a team and implementing integrated competencebased learning modules Strengthfocused concepts like collective efficacy and resilience were used to extend the understanding of the phenomenon Five teacher teams were analyzed in relation to the change itself as well as to protective and risk factors that had an impact on teachers collective efficacy and resilience to the change The data consisted of group interviews and individual questionnaires collected during the process The findings indicate that stronger collaboration creates significant changes in teachers work and students learning and success is based on teacher teams capacity to craft their common work practicesThis paper is concerned with exploring the microsystem of teachers experiences with education reform within the action research AR model for professional development PD Within the macrosystem of current major education reform in the UAE it is timely to explore teachers experiences of AR as PD to improve pedagogy The process of engaging in AR for PD is explored through a pragmatic lens insisting on treating research as a human experience based on the beliefs and actions of practitioners The paradigm of critical pragmatism acknowledges the interpretive cycle but at the same time does not limit the research methods which may be used In this study a survey has been used to gather data The study found that more individual support should be given to teachers during the AR process that teachers should be allocated more inschool time to work on classroombased research and that where applicable more academic research materials need to be made available in languages other than EnglishDevelopments in the last decades necessitated the acquirement of diverse skills that enables to keep up with the changing conditions of todays world In this context teachers as learners are in need of a continuous renewal The acquirement of autonomous learning skills promoted at the teacher education might be contributory for the development of a lifelong learning ability The aim of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the autonomous learning behaviors of prospective German language teachers to determine their actual state Thus the purpose of the study is to identify students autonomous learning behaviors in view of different variables and to discuss the results with respect of learner autonomy and foreign language teacher education For data collection Autonomous Learning Scale was developed and used Nonparametric KruskalWallis and MannWhitney U tests were used to identify whether there is a significant difference between students autonomous learning behaviors according to class age gender and educational background The results of the study showed that there is no statistical significant difference among class level and educational background in terms of autonomous learning but there were statistical significant differences with regards of age and gender Further the subscales planning and performing had on average a higher score as the subscale evaluating The findings of the study indicated that teachers as learners have to be promoted with regard to their actual state Further studies regarding learner autonomy in teacher education are recommended for the promotion of teacher competencesIn the light of Integrative CALL this research aims to know the effectiveness of using online learning platform like a Learning Management Software LMS in teaching writing among ESL students in the absence of a traditional classroom instruction Through a quasiexperimental approach the study was able to establish that there was no significant difference between the pre and postessay overall writing performance of a group which received writing instruction online and a group which received classroom instruction However analysis of the individual scoring components revealed that the onlineinstruction group did not improve in their contentbuilding skill Focus group interviews were also conducted to know the strengths and weaknesses of the onlinebased instruction and it was able to reveal that students consider it to be helpful in acquiring sources and expressing opinions and convenient for lessening issues about time and fear of direct feedback However when it comes to instruction and consultation the students still preferred the facetoface classroom dialogue It was also found how lack of autonomous learning habits can be a hindrance to onlinebased instructionWith academic writing viewed as an important aspect of language instruction there is an increasing interest on how writing education could be improved to better accommodate the needs of multilingual learners To evaluate the empirical evidence from published research studies we conducted a systematic synthesis of the published research that

to understand the extent to which Taiwanese social studies teachers are prepared to grapple with controversial issues in their classrooms To do so we employed a curricularinstructional gatekeeping framework to make meaning of teacher decisions and the contexts in which they work We conducted semistructured interviews withpreservice teachers and five university professors of teacher education in Taiwan The findings suggest that writ large social studies education in Taiwan is largely social science education and within this context preservice teachers have variable conceptualizations of controversial issues which are shaped by a wide variety of external forces that ultimately serve to undermine enactment of discussionOver the past decade teacher autonomy within the formal educational system has been a central topic of discussion among educational stakeholders This study explored influence over school policy and classroom control teacher autonomy among inservice science technology and mathematics STM educators within the United States The National Center for Education Statistics restrictedaccess dataset enabled examination of the study research questions Specifically the Schools and Staffing Survey Teacher Questionnaire SASSTQ was employed for the purposes of this investigation Analysis of data detected differences in both frame variables for influence and control

divided into two categories elite schools and non elite schools This differentiation was made based on fee structure location of schools and salaries offered to teachers Thirtysix indepth interviews were conducted includinginterviews from teachers andfrom school principals Additionally the responses ofteachers were taken through a survey in the selected schools The data reveals that female teachers in both elite and nonelite schools encountered numerous constraints The major issues highlighted by the teachers included low wages lack of support from administration disrespectful behaviour from students and job dissatisfaction The majority considered teaching as a temporary arrangement while they waited for better employment opportunities in other sectors This study recommends that to rescue the profession of teaching the state can play a role by safeguarding the rights of teachers The focus should not be merely on privatization of the education sector but due accountability of private schools is needed not only in terms of quality of education provided but also workplace ethics and resources provided to teachersThe qualitative study shows howteachers fromdistricts in the same state enacted mandated schoolwide writing curricula Analyses of the observations and interviews revealed thatteachers were faithfully following the districtadopted curriculumrejected it andteachers adapted the curriculum to meet their students needs The teachers who followed the curriculum had positive views of it but were inexperienced or uncomfortable teaching writing and had less access to professional development PD than teachers in other groups Most of the teachers who adapted the curriculum were experienced teachers and felt supported in making changes due to the quality of PD The teachers who rejected the curriculum were unhappy with the existing curriculum and drew from a number of different resources however their writing instruction lacked coherence and an underlying philosophy of writing The findings show that factors such as policies PD and personal factors including previous writing experiences and philosophies influenced teachers enactments While previous studies have found that overarching policies including NCLB increase pressure on teachers resulting in a lack of autonomy our findings explore the ways that teachers were able to navigate their school contextsThe article discusses the importance of enhanced student autonomy in creating a learning community with positive culture It explains that a positive culture promotes high graduation rates reduces school violence and boosts school performance The author thinks that a school focused on promoting student autonomy supports a student centered constructivist approach of learningThis work comprises a critical analysis of an educational experience based on the University School model developed in the Faculty of Education of DonostiaSan Sebastian Our fourth grade students of the Early Childhood Education Degree began this experience in thecourse with the organization of psychomotor and science workshopschildren fromschools and their tutors took part in it Among the objectives of this practice firstly we highlight the impact in the autonomy and in the reflective capacity of our students also to lay the foundation for a model of actionresearch in the improvement of our teaching as well as to strengthen ties between the university and the school on the basis of a more egalitarian and dialectical relationship The analysis of the final reports of the workshops our observations and experience of the whole process and a specific questionnaire destined to our students and to the tutors who visited us allow us to characterize this first edition of the workshops Students noted that guiding their own learning process as well as the coevaluation among students increased their sense of selfefficacy and confidence On the other hand tutors who visited us demanded a greater relationship between these workshops and the daytoday work at their school For our part we have clearly evidenced the establishment of a new pedagogical relationship with our students based on trust and requirement Finally the importance of analyzing and evaluating the whole process directly affects the questioning and improving our own teachingThis paper investigates the conceptions of research held by English as a foreign language teachers in Argentina Quantitative data fromparticipants from an online questionnaire were followed by qualitative data from online interviews withof those participants Results show that the teachers conceptualised research through conventional notions closer to a quantitative paradigm They felt research was not part of their job and a lack of time was the main reason for not engaging inwith research Teacher development agency empowerment and autonomy could be sought by engaging teachers with forms of research which are meaningful to them such as action researchThe article outlines background information needed by science teachers in the US to understand the collaborative work of teacher teams TTs aimed at improving student achievement Topics covered include the concept of professional learning communities PLCs advantages of TTs over department meetings the science TT framework and the need for teachers to consider the underlying

commitment to school predict Internet gaming addiction in Korean adolescents and I examined the mediating role of aggression in the relationship between these variables Participants comprisedKorean male high school students who completed surveys that measured aggression family relationships commitment to school and Internet gaming addiction The results showed that aggression family conflict and a lower commitment to school significantly predicted Internet gaming addiction Aggression partially mediated the relationship between family conflict and Internet gaming addiction Thus when adolescents are receiving help for an Internet gaming addiction it is advisable to pay close attention to their aggression and social relationships Theoretical and practical implications are discussedFor most teachers in the United States teaching is no longer a careerlong occupation This article examines the narratives of a particular group of leavers former teachers who made significant investments in their teacher training and who taught for at least three years before making the decision to exit The accounts of these invested leavers are used to look at workplace change as a motivating factor for teacher exit particularly changes in classroom authority that occur after teachers have begun to feel competentBackground Although much is known from educational research about factors that support K teacher professional learning it has been an ongoing challenge to incorporate these factors into practice in new contexts and environments We argue that these factors are too often treated like a checklist of discrete elements either present or not insufficiently attending to the complexities of design and experience To understand how Massive Open Online Courses MOOCs might support K teacher learning it is critical to move beyond application of discrete factors to nuanced navigation of the interplay among researcher examination and theorization designer intention and implementation and learner use and experiencebalancing considerations of learning theory instructional objectives and specific learning context and the desires needs and experiences of participants Focus of Study This study examines MOOCs as a medium for supporting teacher professional learning What did K teachers identify as meaningful about their participation in the Creative Computing Online Workshop CCOW a largescale constructionist online learning experience for teachers How do the teachers experiences relate to each other to learning research and to the affordances of MOOCs Research Design This qualitative interviewbased study draws onsemistructured interviews with participantsyear after they completed CCOW as well as course artifacts We used an iterative approach to develop common themes reflecting what teachers found meaningful and key tensions present in these themes Findings Teachers described four qualities as most meaningful to their learning activity peers culture and relevance Although these qualities were often mutually supporting three key tensions among the qualities and the implications for the design of online teacher learning experiences are discussed autonomy with structure diversity with commonality and experimentation with validation Conclusions This paper challenges the notion that implementing successful professional development for K teachers is simply a matter of following a checklist of design elements This study presents qualities that teachers found meaningful in an online learning experience offering heuristics that designers might consider when designing for their specific contexts Future research might assess to what extent the qualities and tensions identified in this study apply to other contexts and explore the reasons why contextual changes may or may not influence resultsThe purpose of this study was twofold examining the effect of peer coaching on EFL teachers professional identity and learners academic achievement To this end this very mixedmethods research was designed to see the extent to which the least investigated variable in the Iranian EFL setting Five high school RFL teachers were triangularly coached and achievements of their classes including those ofEFL students were investigated The teachers received questionnaire both before and after a session coaching process while being both observed and attended a thinkaloud protocol reporting Moreover the standardized Classroom Observation Sheet was employed whilst the coaching process The students entry and exit academic behaviours in terms of achievements were measured prior to and after the treatment Analyses of each set of data collected from each group indicated that peer coaching entailed statistically significant developments in many categories teachers professional identity as well as in the students academic achievements Pedagogically the findings suggest feasibility and effectiveness of conducting peercoaching and internalizing it in our EFL educational systemThis study investigated the degree to which TESOL Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages training in InnerCircle Englishspeaking countries impacted on the autonomy in teaching practice of Vietnamese teachers of English Using an online survey semistructured indepth interviews and classroom observations the

was to understand teacher perceptions of learning community principles practices and processes at Highland High School and to determine if teacher practices had changed due to the LC framework The study also explored teacher perceptions towards creating a more engaging and effective LC that extends beyond current practices This mixedmethods action research study blended quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis through a faculty survey teacher interviews and document collection at an Illinois high school Study results concludeteachers perceived time support and vision as fundamentalfaculty worked together to teach learn and sharefaculty viewed the LC as a topdown initiative when driven by educational mandates and reforms which restricts shared leadership decisionmaking and teacher autonomystudent engaged learning is perceived as a focal point within the LCteachers perceived professional development opportunities as necessary andteachers perceived climate and culture as important in the LC Most teachers felt the LC framework generally supported LC practices and principles that encouraged change and action although some indicated a focus on mandates was problematic Study implications suggest a LC framework may be more likely to improve teaching learning and professional practices when it contains time for faculty to work a clearly defined vision crosscurricular collaboration trilevel engagement and shared and distributed leadership practices that empower faculty to make decisions PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights

these provided materials with outside materialsmaterials found in their own curricular libraries or from external sources This dissertation proposes a research framework on teachers use of outside materials that leads to the following research questions What motivates teachers to consider using outside curricular materials What approaches do they use to discover outside materials What criteria do they use to evaluate outside materials What steps do they take to prepare or adapt outside materials And what external factors relate to teachers decisions to use outside materials These questions were addressed through an online survey ofelementary teachers across two districts in Western Washington state interviews with nine survey respondents who frequently considered using outside materials and indepth case studies of the decisions of three interviewees The survey revealed that a large majority of teachers considered using outside curricular materials at least once in theschool year that many of them did so frequently and that their reasons for considering outside materials were linked to areas of dissatisfaction with the provided materials A multiple linear regression found that higher teacherreported feelings of curricular autonomy and more years of experience with their provided curriculum predicted higher frequency of considering outside materials The survey also revealed that teachers used a wide variety of approaches to discover outside materials including both online and offline methods Interviews provided detail to these findings revealing that teachers evaluation criteria were aligned with their initial motivation to consider outside materials and that teachers tended to engage in minimal preparation of outside materials Case studies of three focal teachers were used to illustrate different motivations for considering outside materials and different approaches for discovery as well as to elaborate and refine the research framework that guided this investigation This dissertation adds to literature showing that teachers actively participate with curricular materials in order to reach their professional goals and makes a strong case for including attention to outside materials in curriculum development districtlevel decisions and future research PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedRecruitment and retention concerns for teachers particularly in rural school districts and in science fill the daily news and research literature The shortage of STEM workers is also another concern as well Then why do nationally recognized secondary science teachers remain in rural schools with lower salaries increased responsibilities beyond teaching content and multipreparations stay in those schools How do they overcome challenges in their schools This multiple case study focuses on Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching PAEMST awardees who have taught secondary science in rural school districtsyears or more Eight rural PAEMST high school science teachers were identified in Nebraska and the six contiguous states four consented to participate in this study Interviews of these teachers and a colleague principal and or students were conducted to answer the research questions Using a lens of resiliency similarities were identified that show how these teachers overcome adversity and thrived in their rural school and communities Resilient themes that emerged from this study are adaptability autonomy collaborative competency connectedness problemsolvers and resourcefulness Common themes of success for teaching in rural schools for the four teachers were autonomy and relationships Common themes of challenges for teaching in rural schools were diversity funding professional isolation and teaching assignments These characteristics and strategies may help schools with their recruitment and retention of teachers as well as teachers themselves benefiting from hearing other teachers

thinking is more prevalent Although highly structured approaches help develop students foundational skills and content knowledge studentcentered openended approaches foster highlevel thinking aimed by the Common Core State Standards CCSS Literature suggests principals have an important role in the implementation of the CCSS and technology integration but it does not capture the ways principals help teachers adopt highlevel uses of technology This research asks the overarching question What actions decisions and relationships do principals perceive contributed to a classroom culture that utilizes highlevels of technology to meet the expectations of the CCSS A qualitative research design with a phenomenological approach was utilized to discover the knowledge dispositions and actions of principals who were successful in creating a culture of highlevels of technology integration Interviews withpublic middle school principals in Massachusetts and Rhode Island with ample technology resources reaffirm literature and add new understandings Findings show that these technologyoriented principals a were knowledgeable about ways realtime collaborative tools supported student learning b applied their knowledge about highlevels of technology integration in organizational decisions and actions c encouraged experimentation with technology d supported flexible uses of technology and teacher autonomy but continuity with some resources was needed e provided teachers sustained technologyrelated professional development but comprehensive planning was not common f recognized that firstorder barriers continued to persist in their school and g believed that slow implementation and colleagues helped slow adopters overcome secondorder barriers but peer coaching was needed The findings suggest that these principals provided most Essential Conditions of Transformational Learning and applied Professional Standards for Educational Leaders to create a culture of highlevel

ISHSs identified by experts in STEM education as highly successfully in preparing students underrepresented in STEM for STEM majors in college and future STEM careers provides a rich description of the approach to ISHS school leadership by identifying various internal and external leadership factors influencing school leadership This study examined an existing data set that included site visits to four ISHSs along with pre and postvisit data and a crosscase analysis focused on the leadership contributions of ISHS leaders and their larger community This study found that the ISHSs expanded the concept of school leadership to include leadership both within and outside the school In addition school leaders needed autonomy to innovate and respond to their schools needs This included autonomy in hiring new teachers autonomy from school district influence and autonomy from restrictive teachers union regulation and policies Finally ISHSs needed to continually invest in increasing their schools capacities This included investing in teacher professionalization providing pathways for school leadership collaborating with business and industry and identifying the best student supports A product of this study was a proposition for characterizing school leadership in an ISHS This proposition may offer valuable insight implications and information for states and schools districts that may be planning or improving STEM education programs PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThis research examines the relationship between the International Baccalaureate IB program and individual and institutional development as well as the potential of the IB program to increase students social capital Drawing on a case study approach research methods included semistructured interviews witheducators a focus group with students and a focus group with parents and a review of archival material Study findings suggest that educators found the learning curve challenging in opening and sustaining a school with the IB curriculum Teachers reported tension between teaching the transdisciplinary IB content while also needing to attend to state standards on which their students would be tested Educators and parents underscored the experience of uncertainty in terms of issues of staffing space and enrollment often sources of anxiety and sometimes a source of engagement The goals of the IB curriculum combined with the opportunity and resources to shape the direction of a new urban school appear to have sustained a high level of teacher motivation Educator experience suggests the IB curriculum provides teachers with a platform to make significant lasting change in the lives of their students due teachers feelings of professionalism autonomy and willingness to challenge themselves for the betterment of the student body and the school itself In an era of school accountability and national efforts to implement a common core of content standards it is useful to study the growth and struggle encountered by key stakeholders as they participate in building a rich curriculum focused on the whole child and attentive to social academic physical and civic development at its core The study is significant in terms of its ability to offer insights in the development of future IB schools particularly in urban settings PsycINFO Database Record cAPA

quantitative study a survey was developed and administered to middle and high school teachers to examine what factors motivated them to implement problembased learning PBL Using ExpectancyValue Theory by Eccles et aland SelfDetermination Theory by Ryan and Deci b as the theoretical framework this instrument measured respondents perceived competence support for autonomy and relatedness and value and cost they placed on implementing PBL Data analyses indicated that the instrument had good reliability A factor structure was established by exploratory factor analysis which confirmed the construct validity of the instrument Value of PBL to teachers and their students was the most dominant factor that motivated teachers to implement it The second most important factor was their selfefficacy and anxiety about failing this pedagogy and the third factor was teachers perceived autonomy and support from schools and colleagues Regression models showed the predictive power of the factors on teachers intention to implement PBL with their perceptions of the value of PBL being the strongest predictor Results also indicate that teachers with PBL experience perceived significantly higher levels of competence and support from peers and placed a higher level of value and perceived less cost in implementing PBL than teachers who had not implemented PBL Teachers formal training in PBL played a significant role in positively influencing their perceptions of competence and the value of PBL and reduced their perceived cost of implementing PBL This in turn enhanced teachers intention of practicing PBL For teachers who had previously taught with PBL their responses to two openended questions in this instrument corresponded with the theoretical framework of this study and triangulated well with the quantitative data These teachers highly valued PBL and they recognized the challenges associated with its implementation These teachers also emphasized the importance of formal training and support from schools This study provides a holistic view of motivational factors underlying teachers intention to implement PBL and implications for successful implementation of PBL to enhance student engagement PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedTeachers of students with emotional and behavior disorders EBD face challenges regarding interventions that support autonomy and selfdetermination SelfDetermination Theory SDT research indicates that a teacher orientation toward supporting autonomy provides quality prosocial outcomes for students in general compared to teachers who are more controlling in their orientation Despite calls for deeper examination of professional practice of teachers of students with EBD there has been little investigation of teacher interventions designed to promote selfdetermination for students with EBD This study was conducted to partially fill the current gap in research regarding teacher orientation toward autonomy or controlling orientation and teacher use of interventions for students with EBD within a schoolwide positive behavior supports SWPBS system Using a quantitative descriptive and comparative approach the researcher investigated the differences between teachers with autonomous and controlling orientations and the type of interventions utilized by teachers with students with EBD both those that promote selfdetermination and those that do not by utilizing a multivariate analysis of variance MANOVA Participants were teachers in a statewide network of alternative schools in Georgia who serve students with EBD Teachers with an autonomous orientation used significantly fewer interventions not designed to promote the development of selfdetermination skills Implications and recommendations

the programs and methods they incorporate to reach their gifted students In addition to teacher interviews four focus groups of teachers who taught various grade levels were conducted All study participants teach or had taught gifted students To triangulate data artifacts utilized by interviewees were analyzed Participant responses were compared and contrasted to identify patterns and differences It was found that participants felt they were adequately enriching curriculum for gifted secondary mathematics students However in many cases gifted students were not provided with enrichment activities that extended beyond those received by their entire class Participants also felt that they were using adequate grouping methods However teachers often grouped gifted students with the intention of raising the performance of struggling learners In such instances gifted students were not grouped with other high performing students for the advancement of mathematics ability Participants rarely incorporated acceleration and compacting strategies However gifted secondary students routinely took Advanced Placement AP courses as a potential form of acceleration Despite participants largely feeling that they had not been properly or formerly trained to work with gifted students participants expressed feelings of adequacy and confidence in their abilities to work with gifted students in the secondary mathematics environment Participants expressed both advantages and challenges to working with gifted students Advantages included the opportunity to utilize the abilities of gifted students to help struggling learners allowing for teacher and student autonomy within the classroom and having students in the classroom that the teacher can routinely rely on to provide correct answers Challenges included lack of gifted student motivation lack of time to meet the needs of gifted learners and the problem behaviors of gifted students PsycINFO Database Record

educators interested in and successful working with students exhibiting emotional and behavioral disorders An understanding of teacher identity and the personal and professional contexts that contribute to it is critical to the retention of these teachers in the field and the preparation of future special educators Interviews observations and the use of image elicitation provided data to examine each participants identity in relation to the students they taught the school setting and their sense of self Analysis of collected data emphasized their historical past present relationships eg family colleagues professional development and lives within the school Crosscase analysis findings illuminate each teachers reasons for working with students who exhibit challenging behaviors and how their personal experiences shaped their identity and approach to teaching Findings demonstrate how teacherparticipants addressed student autonomy through empowerment or control via an instituted behavioral model Social and relational aspects of teaching effected collaboration within the classroom and school setting Findings from this study indicate several implications Due to the stressful and emotional work environment the field has both a quantity and a quality shortage Preparation programs must offer prospective teachers the chance to observe and participate in daily work within restricted settings while cultivating and recognizing a network of supports Wellplanned mentor and fieldbased programs offer onthejob resources that help incoming teachers with classroom practice and the stimulation of identity development Schools should implement strategies to improve the consistency of instructional aide support for special education teachers It is important to recognize the systemic structures that shape teacher identity Institutional settings rarely challenge the status quo so it is important that teachers resist otherwise practices appear fixed and unalterable While working with students who are emotional aggressive combative and traumatized teachers should detach from maladaptive conduct and not associate the student with their behavior It is essential for special educators experiencing the effects of a school system and the challenges brought by students to practice a method of selfcare PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the standardsbased accountability SBA provisions of No Child Left Behind NCLB on the retention of teachers of color I am interested in this impact given the growing body of evidence suggesting a more diverse teacher workforce would benefit all students particularly students of color VillegasIrvinehowever the teacher workforce is becoming increasingly homogenous and white in part due to the declining retention of teachers of color Overall I hypothesize that the widespread introduction of SBA as prescribed by NCLB has changed teachers instructional practices thereby changing teachers experiences of their job and ultimately their employment decisions Further I posit that those changes in teachers experience particularly reductions in perceptions of classroom autonomy disproportionately impacts the employment decisions of teachers of color IngersollMayIn this study I answer three research questionsHow have trends in teacher retention changed over time and how does that vary by teacher raceethnicityWhat teacher school and organizationalfactors influence teacher retention and how do those vary by teacher raceethnicityHow has the widespread introduction of SBA through NCLB influenced teacher retention and how does that vary by teacher raceethnicity I use the Schools and Staffing Survey SASS and its accompanying Teacher FollowUp Survey TFS to answer my three research questions Overall I confirm an increasing decline in the retention of black and Hispanic teachers and decreasing perceptions of classroom autonomy which coincides with the widespread introduction of SBA through the signing of NCLB inHowever that decline in retention is only significant for black teachers and not for Hispanic teachers byAdditionally using a linear probability model I found that the relationship between perceptions of classroom autonomy and retention varies by teacher raceethnicity and that there is a significant relationship between perceptions of classroom autonomy and retention for black teachers inHowever I did not find that relationship for Hispanic teachers or white teachers Ultimately using a differenceindifference DD model I only found a significant decline in retention for Hispanic teachers as result of the SBA provisions of NCLB however it is unclear how the SBA provisions of NCLB is driving that decline since I did not find a meaningful relationship between perceptions of classroom autonomy and retention for Hispanic teachers In that DD model I did not find a similar decline for black teachers On the contrary I found that black teachers inin states that had previously adopted SBA provisions similar to those in NCLB Prior states experienced a significant decline retention and perceptions of classroom autonomy despite previous exposures to those SBA provisions These counterintuitive results lead me to reinterpret my results applying institutional theory Using institutional theory I concluded that Prior states were able to implement the SBA provisions of NCLB with greater fidelity and therefore the impact of NCLB on perceptions of classroom autonomy and retention was greatest for black teachers in those states Based on these results I offer future research and policy recommendations to improve the diversity of the teacher workforce PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedAutonomy is

teachers changing understanding and application of selfefficacy and the actual effects of data teams on student learning and development PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedToward the improvement of interactions between teachers and atrisk students and academic achievement this correlation study explored teachers attitudes about cultivating teacherstudent relationships and the connection to academic gains Specifically the current study investigated the relationship among three constructs teacher support for student autonomy teacher sense of responsibility for positive teacherstudent relationships and student academic gains among middle school students in a high minority low socioeconomic middle school district in Georgia Based on selfdetermination theory teacher valuation of fostering teacherstudent interactions was operationalized by the Problems in Schools Questionnaire PIS and Teacher Responsibility Scale TRS Teacher level growth percentile median data from theCriterion Referenced Competency Test CRCT administration were used to assess student achievement Information from the PIS and TRS administered online tomiddle school teachers was paired with teacher growth percentile medians Pearson and Spearman Rho correlations were run in SPSS v to determine relationships between teacher sense of responsibility for teacherstudent relationships their support for student autonomy and performance of their students on theCRCT Though no significant association between teachers beliefs about teacherstudent interactions and student achievement was found this study found that teachers of atrisk students support student autonomy and indicate a sense of responsibility for fostering positive teacherstudent relationships PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all

been investigated empirically and rigorously To bridge the gap we investigated the writing proficiency writing assessment ability and written corrective feedback beliefs and practices of Iranian English teachers who gave feedback on learners writings Methods To this endIranian teachers who had the experience of writing instruction and assessment in their classrooms completed two writing tasks assessed and gave feedback on two writing tasks and responded to a researchermade questionnaire inspecting their feedback beliefs and practices and research interest Results The data analysis showed that the teachers writing proficiency did not satisfy the expectations and standards Their writing assessment ability was also not accurate Moreover the data obtained from the questionnaire indicated that the teachers mostly gave unfocused direct written corrective feedback they did not use technology in writing instruction and most of them did not ask the learners to revise the texts which received feedback Furthermore the results showed that a majority of the teachers did not study the research papers because they did not have time and lacked access to the journals Conclusions As the findings of this study showed more research is needed to improve the quality of writing instruction in Iranian classroom context More research seems necessary especially in different contexts to come up with practical suggestions for teachers who give WCF on their students writing and assess and grade writing These are critical issues that merit investigation in future researchFramed within SelfDetermination Theory the purpose of the present study was to test the effects of a training program with physical education PE teachers Participants werehigh school PE teachers experimental group n control group n and theirstudents agedtoyears Teachers in the experimental group received a training program consisting of strategies to support autonomy competence and relatedness need satisfaction A repeated measures ANCOVA was carried out for each dependent variable After the intervention students in the experimental group significantly increased their scores on autonomy support relatedness support autonomy satisfaction autonomous motivation controlled motivation and intention to be physically active as compared to the control group These findings emphasize the utility of a training program with PE teachers to promote the students psychological need satisfaction and hence selfdetermined motivation toward PE classesThe aim of the study was to test the self determination theory SDT sequence to predict physical activity PA and intention to be active during adolescence social factors father mother friends and physical education teacherbasic psychological needs BPNtypes of motivation were assessed PA and intention to be active Participants wereadolescents Magewho completed questionnaires Structural equation modeling supports the SDT sequence model Results revealed that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation positively predicted both PA and intention to be active while amotivation did so negatively Moreover social factors behaved differently with BPN finding positive relationships between father friends and physical education teachers with competence autonomy and relatedness whereas mothers support does not influence the sequence The study shed light on the SDT theory to provide a better understanding of physical activity behaviors and intentions during adolescence PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedAlthough a growing body of quantitative research has examined the noncognitive factors affecting the school engagement and performance of adolescents across cultures there is relatively sparse qualitative research investigating the perceptions of adolescents regarding the factors influencing their engagement and performance in school This focus group study comprisingIndian adolescents from India mean age years andIndian immigrant adolescents from Canada mean age years therefore using a selfdetermination theory perspective explored the perceptions of Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents about the factors affecting their school engagement and performance in India and Canada respectively Thematic analysis of eight focus group discussions suggested that Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents were primarily extrinsically motivated toward school and academics Further both the Indian and Indian immigrant adolescents perceived their classroom teachers as controlling rather than autonomysupportive

influence of various stakeholders on school discipline policy Using data from the SASS and ordered logistic regression this study explores such influence while assessing variation across schools types and changes over time Principals consistently rate themselves and teachers as the most influential stakeholders over setting school discipline policy The proportion of racial minorities in a school predicts greater influence from higher levels of governance while charter schools report less Increases in influence of principals and teachers over time are documented The results may inform both policymakers and practitioners as they work to improve equitable disciplinary outcomes for studentsThe study aimed at examining preservice elementary teachers inquiryoriented curriculum materials in an attempt to unravel their pedagogical design capacity PDC and pedagogical content knowledge PCK for inquirybased learning IBL after attending a professional development program PDP centered around inquirybased teaching and learning In so doing we identified the PCK for IBL dimensions eg integration of inquiry within teachers curriculum designs and evaluation of student learning underpinning their curriculum materials and for each dimension we aimed at finding the characteristics of the teachers curriculum materials and capturing their PCK and PDC concerning that particular dimension The participants werepreservice elementary school teachers enrolled in a PDP that was organized in four phases In each phase the teachers were assigned to a different role namely teachers as learners Phaseteachers as thinkers Phaseteachers as curriculum designers Phaseand teachers as reflective practitioners PhaseThe data sources involved mainly teachers curriculum materials that were analyzed with the use of grounded theory methodology and the constant comparative method The data analysis revealed that the teachers curriculum materials were developed along five PCK for IBL dimensions Moreover a number of characteristics of the teachers curriculum materials were identified for each one of these dimensions which in turn were clustered along three levels of increased sophistication and revealed our teachers PDC per dimension We also managed to identify three different PCK for IBL profiles Finally the findings indicate that even though our preservice teachers attended our specially designed PDP they have conceptualized in diverse ways the underlying principles of IBLThe article discusses the process of browning the curriculum of the history classroom and the role of

in educational institutions The historical evolution of teacher leadership through various phases gives useful insights into how this concept has emerged developed and perceived in different educational contexts and how it appears in todays institutions around the world The definitions of teacher leadership delineate various features of teachers roles responsibilities and their expected contribution to organisational effectiveness while operating in a wide range of formal and informal leadership roles Review of the literature also shows the significance of leadership knowledge and skills for the academic leadership positions that need to be fostered in a school context Moreover it highlights factors that might hinder the emergence of teacher leadership in academic institutions The last section of this paper indicates a void in the literature on the issue of teacher leadership in the field of Teaching of English to the Speakers of Other Languages TESOL that also directs researchers endeavours towards investigating this concept in the context of English language teachingTeacher retention in the STEM fields is of national interest Several factors such as job satisfaction classroom control and school influence have been linked to teachers leaving the profession By statistically analyzing various questions from the Schools and Staffing Survey Teacher Questionnaire this study evaluated the current state of how early career mathematics science and career and technical education CTE teachers perceive their classroom control and influence over school policy The results show that CTE teachers perceive they have significantly more influence over school policy than mathematics teachers CTE teachers also reported having significantly more classroom control than both mathematics and science teachers By understanding the current state of how CTE perceive school influence and classroom control compared to their mathematics and science teacher counterparts further research can be conducted to address job satisfaction and teacher retention in the CTE fieldsWe investigate the effects of teambased learning TBL on motivation and learning in a quasiexperimental study The study employs a selfdetermination theory perspective to investigate the motivational effects of implementing TBL in a physiotherapy course in higher education We adopted a onegroup pretestposttest design The results show that the students intrinsic motivation identified regulation perceived competence and perceived autonomy support significantly increased going from lectures to TBL The results further show that students engagement and perceived learning significantly increased Finally students amotivation decreased from pretest to posttest however students reported higher external regulation as a function of TBL Path analysis shows that increases in intrinsic motivation perceived competence and external regulation positively predict increases in engagement which in turn predict increases in perceived learning We argue that the characteristics of TBL as opposed to lectures are likely to engage students and facilitate feelings of competence TBL is an activelearning approach as opposed to more passive learning in lectures which might explain the increase in students perception of teachers as autonomy supportive In contrast the greater demands TBL puts on students might account for the increase in external regulation Limitations and practical implications of the results are discussedThis paper focuses on the conceptual model of an academic course inspired by complexity theory In the proposed conceptual model the aim of teaching is to form a learning organization a knowledge community with emergent properties that cannot be reduced to any linear combination of the properties of its parts In this approach the learning of the participants depends not so much on their individual action as on being the coevolving parts of a selforganized whole In this design the role of the educator is to catalyze emergence and to facilitate bottomup knowledge production To achieve this we present a systematic way to orchestrate inclass facetoface activities in small groups while utilizing common web technologies to facilitate online collective actionThis study reports on the perspectives of a group of Iranian EFL teachers about

individually and the violation of this right Research Methods Data was collected using a qualitative interview methodteachers from state schools andfrom two private schools in totalclass teachers in Aydn who taught in theacademic year participated and the data was analyzed via content analysis Findings The conclusion was reached that the private lives of the school class and teachers was violated It was concluded that parents and teachers violated the schools private life parents and students violated the classs private life and teachers violated other teachers private life at the state primary school Parents were generally the ones who violated the private life of the school class and teachers at private primary schools Implications for Research and Practice In accordance with these results it would be beneficial to inform teachers administrators students and parents about the right of privacy and about the scope and limits of the schools classs and teachers right to privacy It would be useful to study performed using a qualitative approach in other educational institutions using quantitative research techniquesPurpose Student engagement and interest in class are important conditions for active learning For this they must be highly motivated In other words students who have high motivation make an effort to be engaged in class Thus knowing students motivation level is important for active engagement in class The aim of the present study is to study the relationship between class engagement and motivation levels among high school students Research Methods We conducted our study using a relational research model The study population comprised students attending high schools in the Ankara central district Somehigh school students selected by simple random sampling in Ankara province were administered the scale Of the scales responded towere included in the study Findings When students learning orientations were examined they were seen to have adopted masteryoriented learning mostly followed by performanceavoidance oriented and performanceapproach oriented learning When the results of the analysis were viewed according to variables there is a significant difference in terms of gender school type and grade The result of the present study suggests that masteryoriented learning is a significant predictor of all dimensions of class engagement Implications for Research and Practice The research has revealed that motivation level is related to class engagement that vocational school students are affected more by motivational factors and that motivation level decreases as grade level increases Also masteryoriented learning is a significant predictor of all dimensions of class engagement There is yet more research needed on the gender variable Along this line it may be suggested that use of intrinsic drives may increase success rates of vocational school students Teachers and school administrators must use more motivational tools for vocational school students Also inclass activities may be planned to make high school seniors more engaged in class It is believed that the future research must focus on the gender variable and investigate the relationship between the roles of teachers in class and student motivation levelsThis study examines how various teacher characteristics and contextual factors are related to early primary teachers beliefs about mathematical teaching and learning and teachers attitudes toward their own learning of mathematics A total ofearly primary teachers across Nebraska participated in the study Teacher characteristics and contextual factors were grouped into four sets teacher professional background teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching teaching contexts and students experiences

cooperating teachers is a longstanding problem in teacher education as is the haphazard nature and quality of field experiences This study ofpreservice andcooperating teachers inuniversitybased credentialing programs in California examined the difference preparation made in how cooperating teachers enacted their role as well as the relationship between preservice teachers perceptions of cooperating teacher practice and their ratings of their field experience A significant finding was that cooperating teachers who received preparation for their role reported greater enactment of practices overall and in particular practices related to prompting reflection and goal setting Preservice teachers field ratings strongly correlated to their perceptions of cooperating teacher practice Implications are for design and implementation of professional development for cooperating teachers to improve field experience qualityOverstates have adopted the edTPA as a performance assessment for preservice teachers While many have adopted the edTPA as a program requirement few require the edTPA for licensure of individual teacher candidates but many states are poised to do so While the edTPA is grounded on experiences with advanced certification and program level uses of teacher performance assessments the research in these areas has focused on program implementation Little research features student teacher voices and the impact of the assessment on the student teaching experience The purpose of this article is to describe the perspectives of the first rounds of teacher candidates who completed the edTPA as a licensure exam while student teaching in multiple initial certification programs within a single School of Education In addition to score results and student work indepth interviews and survey responses were the primary data collected and analyzedIn spite of pass rates overwithat mastery levels across programs during the first two cohorts of implementation candidate perceptions revealed contradictory views of the edTPA and its impact on candidate learning and the student teaching experience These experiences are discussed in consideration of four themes that explore the edTPA as a reflective educative mandated and subtractive experience In light of the use of the edTPA as a highstakes test for individual licensure important considerations and cautions for teacher educators policymakers and administrators poised to phase in fullscale implementation of this assessment for highstakes purposes are raisedThe article presents

national and international education agendas Traditional universityled forms of teacher education continue to be challenged and defended as nations strive to secure a teaching force equipped to achieve highquality learning outcomes for all students One commonly adopted policy solution has been the diversification of teacher preparation routes the alternative certification agenda In this article we examine the entire history of one alternative route in place in England fromtothe Graduate Teacher Programme Using one example of an employmentbased programme we argue that opportunities to engineer innovative and creative spaces in the face of the current teacher preparation reform agenda need to be seized This case study which is contextualised in both the international debates about alternative teacher certification routes and the current policy agenda in England demonstrates the extent to which successive administrations have failed to learn from the lessons of the past in the rush to recycle policies and claim them as their own PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe article analyzes foreign experience in continuing professional development of teachers It has been found that the system of continuing professional development of teachers in foreign countries has its own conceptual peculiarities determined by relevant contextual factors It has been specified that all systems are characterized by personalityoriented approach to professional development of teachers available organizational and pedagogical conditions for development flexibility diversity of forms and training content Such an approach can enhance professionalism of teachers their ability to provide students with highquality and effective teaching in accordance with the needs of a market economy It has been outlined that professional development of teachers is the most effective at the level of an educational institution in the course of daily teaching activities provided the forms of this process organization are diverse The key factor which influences effectiveness of continuing professional development is the teachers ability to reflect motivation responsibility and academic mobility within professional development It has been clarified that a number of countries apply national mechanisms for recognizing the results of teachers professional development their certification We believe it necessary to creatively use foreign innovative experience to enhance continuing professional development of teachers in Ukraine namely to create a multilevel system of continuing professional development of vocational education teachers and introduce motivational mechanisms for stimulating their professional growthEcoJustice Education is both a framework for thinking about

PBE is gaining rapid recognition across the United States The authors of this article contend that there is an imperative need to restructure and reconceptualize teacher education such that it allows for a significant shift in thinking and practice around learning teaching and community They advocate that the PBE model is ideally suited to this end Among the many strengths of PBE is the flexibility inherent in the model such that it can and must be adapted to authentically represent individual communities In their work with PBE the authors have identified three core pedagogical anchors inquirybased instruction connection to place and informed civicengagement that uniquely represent the transformative work they are doing in teacher education Along with examples and explanation of the three pedagogical anchors the article also provides a brief discussion of the creation of the PBE teacher preparation pathway at Eastern Michigan UniversityThe purpose of the study

among nonnormal students A large number of nonnormal college students have obtained the teacher certification by taking the qualification exam It is found that there are all kinds of attitudes to the students participating in this exam Firstly they once had to choose a nonnormal major on account of different reasons although they expect to be teachers Secondly they hold a blind attitude that all their friends take part in it Thirdly it is a practical way to have a job choice after graduation Therefore we have a responsibility to remind the students to treat the examination rationally because it cant ensure them the capabilities required for a qualified teacher even if they have passed three or four subjects Meanwhile those who participate in the exam only plan to increase the possibility of getting employed instead of genuine enthusiasm for education can hardly enjoy satisfaction and happiness Therefore the nonnormal students should recognize and understand the true purpose of the examination and make a rational career planning At the same time the government needs to improve the teacher qualification examination systemThe article focuses on the recognition of high performing

growing diversity in school polulation many teacher educators fail incorporating diversityrelated content into the courses they teach As a result numerous preservice teachers lack quality learning opportunities to become well versed on issues of diversity in meaningful ways This article reports the results of an international study which explores preservice teacher perceptions of opportunity to learning to teach in diverse inclusive classrooms A questionnaire was used to document the perceptions of a cohort of kindergarten and elementary student teachers from Spain and the US Results indicated that strong international differences existed in the perceptions of respondents towards opportunity to learn theoretical aspects of teaching for diversity eg know intervention strategies to meet student diverse educational needs opportunity to learning to teach inclusively eg learn how to develop an inclusive curriculum and opportunity to observe and analyse practical aspects of diversity teaching eg conduct diversityrelated fieldwork all these differences favouring US respondents The results highlight the need for increased attention to teaching diversity in preservice

all students especially those who are English learners School districts nationwide are attempting to expand K dual language programs yet teaching and learning for biliteracy development are highly complex processes especially with middle level learners Furthermore there is a severe shortage of dual language teachers posing great difficulties to efforts to expand programs especially in middle and secondary schools This qualitative case study focuses on two middle level teachers perspectives regarding the distinct qualities of biliteracy development via the science curriculum and the unique sociocultural aspects of language learning in middle school The study and its findings also provide insight into how the distinctive qualities of dual language learning in contentbased middle level classrooms might influence middle level teacher education programsBackground Inadequacy of authoritybased defensive teaching and summative and productbased evaluation such as certification and observation measures in providing information about the actual teaching teachers do was an inspiration in this study to design an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competences This study aimed at designing an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competencesMethods To this end teacher competences were theoretically defined and the indicators of competence in practice were derived and operationalized through Competency Framework for Teachers proposed by department of education and training in Australiaby a panel of five EFL English as a foreign language teaching experts through focused group discussion The resulting inventory wasitems on four teacher competences including critical clinical personal and technical competences from three perspectives of student departmental learning and growth measured onpoint likert scaleResults Testing the inventory withIranian EFL teachers indicated that there were high Cronbachs alpha reliability indices for the three main perspectives and their dimensions This implies that the inventory enjoyed appropriate internal consistency The results of exploratory factors analysis indicated that there was no construct irrelevant factor and all the indicators were loaded in the related teacher competence and perspective dimension Four separate structural equation models SEM were tested in order to probe the trait structure of the inventory The first three SEM models targeted the three perspectives individually while the last model explored the structure of the total data The results indicated that all items had significant contributions to their respective dimensionsConclusions The potential application of this inventory in teacher education programs and the factors that limit its applicability were discussedIn recent years there was been a raft of criticisms of the way that grades or marks are assigned to students The purpose of this paper is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of grading systems and grading practices drawing upon both historical and contemporary research and writing Five questions are used to frame the review and organize the paper They areWhy do we grade studentsWhat do grades meanHow reliable are students gradesHow valid are students grades andWhat are the consequences of grading students The results suggest thatThe are several purposes for grading students the way that grades are assigned and reported should be consi stent with the specified purposeGrades mean different things to different people including the teachers who assign themGrades on a single task eg a test or project a homework assignment are quite unreliable whereas cumulative grades that is those based on several data sources are reasonably reliableThe validity of grades on a single task is virtually impossible to determine however the evidence suggests that cumulative grades are reasonably validGrades influence a variety of student affective characteristics eg selfesteem However their influence is no greater nor less than a host of other schoolrelated factorsThe author discusses the amount of workload that could come in for

fired overpublic school teachers as the city underwent a transition to a marketbased system of charter schools Using administrative data we examine whether and how these teachers returned to public school employment and teaching We estimate that school reform and dismissal substantially increased teacher exit from the district and the state relative to similar teachers in other parishes that suffered hurricane damage Dismissed teachers who returned were more likely to be Black and locally trained but new hiring through alternative certification programs led to a substantial demographic shift A teacher population that had been highly experienced and more thanBlack shifted through new hiring at charter schools Implications for other districts considering teacher employment reforms are discussedThis qualitative case study conducted at a small private university in the US found that preservice teacher selfefficacy increased over the course of four semesters when taught inquirybased instruction from a Social Constructivist Theoretical framework This study utilized A Draw a Science Teacher Test Checklist DASTTC created by Thomas Pederson and Finsonand required students to draw themselves both at the beginning and end of the semester Additionally three themes were found in the reflections of the students which included teacher as facilitator students as teachers learning through inquiry Based on these findings it is clear that preservice teachers attitudes and beliefs can be changed based on university instructional and course designThis study aims to describe students mathematics achievement influencing factors in Indonesia Japan and Turkey at the student level and by school level with the use of TIMSS dataThe sample used in this study is the fourth grade of elementary school students fromcountries participating in TIMSSnamely Indonesia N Japan N and Turkey N The findings indicated that there is no dissimilarity in mathematics learning achievement among students in Indonesia Japan and Turkey The students selfconcept of mathematics proved itself a significant factor influencing their learning achievement across Indonesia Japan and Turkey while school climate factors only significantly affects the students mathematics learning achievement in Indonesia and Turkey The results also show the benefit of students mathematics selfconcept to be formed or inculcated early before elementary school through positive school climate because both have a positive contribution on student learning achievement in mathematics In general it can be concluded that the affective characteristics student mathematics selfconcept and independent factors by the level of school school climate can only explain a small variance of achievement of student in learning mathematicsThe present article is based on a smallscale research that took place with the students in the Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics inand three years later with the students of the same Department and the Department of Computer Science as well Students who have enrolled in the Educational sciencePedagogy module that the Department

listed reflecting students perspective of the module Educational sciencePedagogy and come to the conclusion that we present no module is uselessNational and statebased science and Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM initiatives expect educators to incorporate inquiry and designbased practices into their STEMcentric lesson planning While this is a new expectation and may be a challenge for all it is an even more prohibitive barrier for elementary teachers who often find STEM outside of their comfort zones Graduate coursework sensitive and attentive to elementary teachers needs is essential to prepare teachers for these instructional demands The Elementary STEM Instructional Leadership ESIL graduate program at McDaniel College a small liberal arts school in Maryland developed such a program in conjunction with Carroll County Public Schools and the National Institute of Aerospace The pilot cohort of elementary teachers for the ESIL program was the audience for this quantitative study Lesson plans developed by this cohort were assessed to gauge the teachers proficiencies in planning STEMcentric lessons A proportion of agreement consensus and test of hypothetical value provided results that suggest that the sample population demonstrated proficient planning abilities for targeted standards Findings from this research not only add to the fields knowledge of elements in the promotion of graduate coursework that leads to elementary inservice teachers proficiency in planning STEMcentric lessons but also have broader implications for teacher education at large The McDaniel College ESIL model could frame flexible K teacher education as it promotes analytical thinking and selfreflectionThe present paper looks at the issue of standardization in L oral testing Whereas external examiners are frequently used globally some countries opt for testtakers own teachers as examiners instead In the present study Sweden is used as a case in point with a focus on the mandatory highstakes summative ninthgrade national test in English speaking part The national test has the typical characteristics of standardized tests and its main objective is to contribute to equity in assessment and grading on a national level However using teachers as examiners raises problems for standardization The aim of this study is to examine teachersexaminers practices and views regarding four aspects of the speaking testtesttaker grouping recording practices the actual test occasion and examiner participation in students test interactionsand to discuss findings in relation to issues concerning the normativity and practical feasibility of standardization taking the perspectives of testtakers teachersexaminers and test constructors into account In order to answer research questions linked to these four aspects of L oral testing selfreport survey data from a random sample of teachers N and teacher interviews N were collected and quantitative data were analyzed using inferential statistics Survey findings revealed that despite thorough instructions teacher practices and views vary greatly across all aspects which was further confirmed by interview data Three background variablesteacher certification work experience genderwere investigated to see whether they could provide explanations Whereas certification and gender did not contribute significantly to explaining the findings work experience bore some relevance but effect sizes were generally small The study concludes that using teachers as examiners is a wellfunctioning procedure in terms of assessment for learning but raises doubts regarding assessment of learning and standardization a solution for test authorities could be to frame the test as nonstandardizedIn this article the author suggests that educators should create network and take deliberate steps out into the network of assets around their classrooms and shift alter and work

bifurcation the educator preparation community in Vermont faced either the adoption of a generic product for the assessment of initial educator licensure candidates or the comprehensive revision of a longstanding statebased assessment portfolio Using a case study approach and narrative methods specifically the Narrative Policy Framework McBeth JonesShanahanthe authors analyze a project in which teacher educators intervened to shape the direction of educator preparation policymaking by designing an innovative assessment portfolio and a collaborative calibration system The analysis reveals insights about the policymaking arena and demonstrates the value of educationrelated policymaking that includes teacher educators as active agents in collaboration with state personnel and policymakers The case contributes to the notion of policymaking as a narrative process In this case a narrative of hope emerged as a guiding storylineFailure to adequately prepare teachers of emergent bilingual EB students could have devastating consequences for student achievement EB reclassification and eventually high school and college completion To enhance the policy discourse we explore how teacher certification requirements relate to both EB student achievement and teacher selfefficacy in three states with similar EB student populations but disparate policies on ways to meet EBs needs Arizona California and Texas To do this we askHow well do states prepare their teachers to meet the needs of EBsWhat knowledge specific to meeting EBs needs do states require their teachers to demonstrateHow are these requirements related to teacher perceptions of their preparedness to effectively teach EBs We find that there are marked differences across the three states in terms of how well they prepare EBs and these patterns can be discerned from their teacher preparation requirements Although teachers selfefficacy does not appear to be related to teacher training in the first three years of teaching there is an advantage to more rigorous training over time Implications for policy are discussedAs university supervisors at a large urban university in the southern US we examined the ways that the Education Teacher Performance Assessment edTPA shaped the pedagogic relationships and decisionmaking processes of our students and ourselves during the spring ofWe situated this study of edTPA within the framework of critical policy scholarship Gracecited in Lipmanby reviewing the role of tests in licensing teachers in the context of the perpetual reform of US education We drew upon Biestasnotion that neoliberal accountability trades democratic relationships for consumer relationships and Attick and Boylesargument that edTPA resituated student teaching as a marketplace activity Applying selfstudy methodology SamarasFreesewe documented our experiences of supervising preservice teachers as they underwent the edTPA submission process We found the assessment strongly controlled our relationships with our candidates As supervisors we became part of our candidates transaction towards certification Likewise our candidates viewed us as arbitrators who could help them align themselves and their work to edTPAs specifications Nevertheless we found moments that superceded the control of edTPA We conclude with recommendations that teacher education programs attend closely to their social justice missions and develop new critical pedagogies in the face of the pressure of edTPAThis article explores how candidates experiences in multiple initial certification programs within a single School of Education evolved over the first three semesters of New Yorks implementation of edTPA as a requirement for initial licensure The data reviewed included primarily surveys and interviews of teaching candidates framed by critical perspectives on accountability teacher performativity and constructivist theories on learning to teach Results suggest candidates perceptions of program alignment and edTPA benefits improved while several challenges persisted These included the lack of mentor teacher knowledge about the edTPA as well as disconnects between candidates edTPA scores and local program evaluations Additionally student teachers perceptions of a subtractive experience of the edTPA continued in spite of improved perceptions about the benefits of the exam and across all scoring levels programs and semesters A discussion of these results considers the implication of policies that reify quality compel performance management and contribute to values conflict for candidates in the particularly unique developmental moment of learning to teach These voices of student teachers often underrepresented in the research on edTPA urge a reconsideration of the policy on teacher performance assessments in terms of how such policies impact the experiences of those learning to teachThis paper deals with the skills related to the early reading acquisition in two countries that share language Traditionally on reading readiness research there is a great interest to find out what factors affect early reading ability but differ from other academic skills that affect general school learnings Furthermore it is also known how the influence of prereading variables in two countries with the same language affect the development of the reading On the other hand several studies have examined what skills are related to reading readiness phonological awareness alphabetic awareness naming speed linguistic skills metalinguistic knowledge and basic cognitive processes but there are no studies showing whether countries can also influence the development of these skillsOur main objective in this study was to establish whether there were differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between Spanishchildren and Peruvianchildren five years old children assessed in their own countries and after controlling Economic Social and Cultural Status ESCS The results show that there are significant differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between these two samples Its especially relevant in these results that the main predictor in a regression study was the country of origin explaining a higher percentage of variance than other variables such as age differences in months or gender These findings corroborate the results obtained in other studies with migrant populationThe article informs that the English Department of Bowling Green State University BGSU provides Decolonial Theory and Methodology as a

become more promising however the probability of early ASD diagnoses does not always extend to African American children This disparity has decreased the likelihood that African American children will benefit from early intervention services This qualitative inquiry explored via semistructured interviews the perceived factors that facilitate and impede early diagnoses and access to services among African American parents of young children with ASD A constant comparative approach was employed andthemes related to diagnoses services and recommendations emerged eg parent knowledge of ASD as a facilitator to diagnosis aggressive advocacy as a barrier to accessing services and parent education as a recommendation for addressing identified barriers Parent advocacy and partnerships with professionals were overarching themes in this study Implications for parent training related to knowledge of ASD parent advocacy and partnerships with professionals are discussedNew semiotic perspectives about the role of language in mathematics education indicate that teachers have a fundamental role in communicating and teaching the language that carries mathematical meaning However little is known about how educators of young children understand and use the language of mathematics This study addresses this void Supported by the understanding that mathematics has its own language Pimmthe study focuses on code switchingthe mixing of words from two languagesby educators as they shift between the language of instruction and the language of mathematics A qualitative multiple case study approach utilizing discourse analysis was used to explore three early years teachers math talk Findings indicate that these educators codeswitched to the mathematics register when they talked about numbers number words and counting to revoice students ideas to explain students and teachers actions to provide new math information and when they chose between two terms that belonged to the math register Findings also demonstrated that educators preferred to avoid the use of the mathematics register and relied instead on what the educators called familiar language Findings further indicated the presence of semantic patterns between perceptual terms and the mathematics registerTo meet the everincreasing teaching standards preservice special educators need extensive and advanced opportunities for pedagogical preparation prior to entering the classroom Providing opportunities for preservice special educators to practice such strategies within a virtual simulation environment

assessments The quality of teachers who provide these students with math instruction is an unexamined variable that could influence this low achievement We used data from more thanmillion students to compare the quality of teachers assigned to teach math to fourth through eighthgrade SWDs and students without disabilities using multiple indicators of teacher quality Overall SWDs had access to teachers of similar quality as their peers but grouping all disabilities masked heterogeneity Students with learning disabilities were onlytopercentage points more likely than their peers to have teachers with special education certification Based on our findings the low math achievement of SWDs is unlikely to be the result of limited access to the same teacher quality as their peers without disabilitiesAbstract This article discusses ideas that will likely figure prominently in the development of the field of heritage language HL studies over the next five decades Drawing on the ideals that prompted the launch of the Heritage Language Initiativeyears ago and building on the accomplishments of the field since then we make several proposals for advancing research and instruction to better serve the needs of HLspeaking youth and communities as well as the nation at large With this overarching goal we focus in particular on the ways to institutionalize HL education in foreign language departments and mainstream it in the larger US educational systemTeachers are expected to accommodate an increasingly heterogeneous student population However teachers often feel ill prepared and hence may be apprehensive toward the inclusion of students with special education needs SEN in regular classrooms This paper concerns factors associated with the successful implementation of inclusive education More specifically it considers teacher characteristics that may facilitate or hinder the inclusion of students with SEN The paper first discusses teacher competencies concerning the accommodation of students with SEN in regular classrooms not only as a determinant of effective inclusive practice but also in relation to teacher attitudes toward inclusive education Second we investigate to what extent teacher attitudes both toward students with SEN and inclusive education may affect teaching behaviors and positive action toward students with SEN The paper further discusses training methods that could be applied to increase teacher competence and foster positive attitudes in an attempt to strive to a more equitable educational systemHybrid teacher leadership

training of Reading Recovery trainers To achieve accreditation the training programme was required by the International Reading Recovery Trainers Organization to be linked to the IOE doctor of education EdD Specifically apprentice trainers were required to complete a minimum of Yearof the EdD programme the InstitutionFocused Study successfully as a gateway to achieving their professional qualification The IOE EdD allowed for a unique apprenticeship model that combined academic study and research at doctoral level together with practical experiences This paper presents a case study of the apprenticeship model as viewed by professionals who have undergone the experience Findings suggest similarities to previous reports on professional doctorates but also suggest a bridge and transition from apprentice to an apprentice who is also a mentor A range of tensions are also suggested some of which have been described by previous authors but also others that have not previously been reported Apprentice trainers reported feeling like weird fish in that although their apprenticeship model was part of the EdD it did not fit with experiences the rest of their cohorts received Nevertheless there was a sense of preparedness for participants new complex professional roles Implications of findings for linking the EdD to specific professional roles are also discussedAgricultural education teacher preparation programs across the United States are implementing highstakes teacher performance assessments to better prepare preservice teachers for the rigors of classroom teaching During pilot implementation of edTPA a standardized teacher performancebased assessment University of Georgia UGA teacher preparation unit implemented a technology mediated observation TMO protocol to replace one of three facetoface observations conducted by university supervisors The instrumental case study reported here explores the outcomes of the TMO experience from the emic perspective of the preservice teachers their cooperating teachers and university supervisors Findings indicate that TMO overall was a positive experience for preservice teachers because they engaged in selfmonitoring reflexive teaching practices and it created opportunities for participants to collaborate with other professionals in their placement sites We conclude that the use of TMO was overall beneficial to the preservice teaching experience by enhancing reflective behavior among participants to improve teaching practice To improve the practice of using TMO teacher educators should provide wellplanned processes for the preservice teaching cohort Future research should focus on how TMO can be used to improve quality instruction in the student teaching experienceResearchers have called for greater levels of teacher preparation There remains many questions about the extent to which graduate education contributes in a positive way to student

preservice teachers sensemaking in a fieldbased practicum as they learn to teach reading to children identified as struggling readers Researchers agree that fieldbased experiences coupled with time for reflection benefit preservice teachers as they learn to teach reading However research is not as clear about which features of practicum experiences lead to preservice teacher learning which may contribute to preservice teacher misconceptions and how learning about reading instruction might be rendered more visible to researchers Grounded in sociocultural perspectives analysis focused on language as a mediating tool for the construction of knowledge Data collection spanned three semesters in a literacy assessment and intervention practicum Preservice teachers constructed understandings of readers and reading instruction through reflecting planning and articulating their decisionmaking processes with one another in an online discussion board Findings indicate that analysis of preservice teachers computermediated discussions provided a window into their sensemaking processes While some preservice teachers discourse demonstrated marked growth other preservice teachers limited use of precise language related to reading assessment and intervention frequently inhibited their developing understandings and instructional decisions Also some of the decisions instructors made likely contributed to several of the preservice teachers misconceptions We conclude with implications for computersupported collaborative environments in teacher education as a means to make preservice teacher learning more visible and accessible as a tool for teaching and learningThe aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of two written journal techniques used to

working conditions salary size and professional outcomes of teachers at schools that switched to the competitive performancebased socalled effective contract in comparison with teachers at schools that did not switch to this employment framework The study focused on teachers atvocational secondary schools VSS that are subordinate to the Ministry of Education ofMoscow Region We conducted an opinion poll to obtain direct information from teachers We sent questionnaires consisting ofquestions toteachers Of the respondentswere included in the experimental group andwere placed in the control group The results of our study show that teachers who work in organizations that have switched to the effective contract model have a higher subjective assessment of their own financial situation greater expectations regarding their future income greater confidence about the compensation plan and a better opinion of the prestige of the teaching profession than teachers at schools that have not adopted an effective contract The only parameter that cannot be interpreted as an unambiguously positive result is an increase in the frequency of teacher performance assessments at schools that have adopted an effective contract It was also possible to establish the existence of a moderate relationship between the individual nature of the employment contract and the level of trust that teachers have in their compensation plan In addition we established another moderate relationship between informedness and the level of trust that teachers place in their compensation plan Thus we can recommend implementing the performancebased contract model at all VSS in the Moscow Region because it has a positive impact on the immaterial motivation and financial position of teachers By conducting additional measures to increase teachers informedness about effective contracts we can increase their level of trust in themA vociferous policy debate concerning Teach For America TFA and

routes is still in its infancy In contrast to their peers who complete traditional initial teacher education programs these teachers are exposed to different conditions and constraints that produce a range of subidentities previously unidentified in the literature This paper draws on interviews withteachers who entered teaching through Teach For America and wrestled with these subidentities as they considered their emerging professional identity We argue that these subidentities point to structural challenges embedded within Teach for America and we highlight the need for additional research on the growing cadre of teachers entering the teaching profession through alternative routes and subsequently influencing policymaking processesThe present article deals with the initial

The recertification process varies between provinces and is a fulltime training process following an assessment of IETs foreign credentials Through interviews with IETs and professionals I explored the prevalent conceptions of the good teacher in one IET recertification program I argue that while WesternEastern conceptions of the good teacher differ they could complement and strengthen each other particularly in the multicultural space of BC Yet in the recertification process Eastern conceptions of the good teacher were viewed as deficient and thus spaces for IETs to bring their experiences and voices to bear on reconstructing their professional identity in Canada were closed downThe goal of this metaanalysis is to evaluate how instructional technology has impacted advanced second language AL development Although numerous metaanalyses have been conducted within the CALL literature over the past two decades they primarily focus upon learning outcomes and related effect sizes None focus on advanced learning per se Where AL is even mentioned which is only rarely little or no attention is paid to critical research parameters within the studies that are analyzed Most notably in summarizing learning outcomes the linguistic competence of learners claimed to be at advanced level is simply taken at face value So too no consideration is given to the difficulty level of tasks undertaken by students or their appropriateness to students claimed proficiency It is the intent of this general overview of the contribution of CALL to AL to address these issues through a comprehensive analysis of the publications in four prominent CALL journals CALICO CALL Language LearningTechnology and ReCALL over someyears In so doing the Performance Descriptors PD and NCSSFLCanDo Statements CDS of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages ACTFL are adopted as external criteria for establishing student competence level task difficulty and appropriateness This study concludes that not only are CALL AL studies extremely limited in number and focus but also that they suffer from serious design flaws that call into question a great portion of the claims made regarding the contribution of instructional technology to the furthering of advancedlevel foreign language competenceLGBTQ themes are often neglected in many schools curriculum Currently an LGBTQinclusive curriculum framework is not required in most school districts across the county Therefore it is important to understand how teachers regard LGBTQ issues how they address the needs of

archival and secondary sources we found that the professionalization process of the secondary teachers in CentralEastern Europe AustroHungarian Monarchy followed the French and the German patterns Furthermore the political elite used different elements of these patterns in order to be able to implement the European reforms into the national level Therefore we would say that the implementation process in this area was a kind of reflexion which was necessary to adjust the modernisation influences to their social and economic conditions However the study also concerns developing processes of the modern science of education and pedagogy and the forming processes of modern national states After analysing our sources we were convinced of the need to direct our focus to these questions Both of them played decisive role in the professionalization process Different steps of the formation of the modern national state boosted the development of teacher professions by adopting new regulations or laws Changes of the state and the society also facilitated the transformation of universities and teacher training institutes These aspects clearly could be seen in the development of the Hungarian secondary teacher profession in the second half of the th centuryThe Postgraduate Certificate in Education PGCE has been a successful and popular initial teacher education ITE programme since the s

experience is a known determinant of student achievement I show that teacher experience also affects the achievement of a childs younger siblings In contrast teacher experience does not have an effect on the test scores of the childs older siblings suggesting that direct sibling effects rather than parental behavior responses are more important These findings suggest that we are underestimating the importance of education inputs by ignoring the spillover effects on siblingsResearch on novice ESLEFL teachers identity development often characterizes the teaching practicuminternship as a boundarycrossing period in which preservice teachers move out of the sheltered environment of education to become inservice teachers in real classrooms Nevertheless many prospective teachers experience a prolonged preservice period in which an examinationbased selection mechanism is used to gatekeep teacherdom Through the lens of liminality the study explores the experiences of two Taiwanese preservice secondary EFL teachers during a period filled with highstakes recruitment examinations By examining how the two participants negotiate their identities and learn about the profession amid the disheartening challenges and learning opportunities they face during liminality the study gives voice to preservice teachers caught in between institutional structures and allows them to articulate their struggles as well as their sense of agency in pursuing a teaching career The findings yield practical implications for EFL teacher education and the examinationbased selection mechanismThe article discusess various court cases Topics discussed include EF v Newport Mesa Unified Sch Dist court case addressing Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Salazar v S San

Michigan eliminated its elementary arts specialists Research questions wereWhat policy conditions enabled the Lansing School Districts decision to cut its elementary arts specialists andHow did the decisionmaking process unfold This instrumental case study drew on policy analysis and data sources includedinterviews with former Lansing School District teachers current employees and community arts provider representatives as well as related documents and researcher memos After coding for themes I used the Advocacy Coalition Framework to organize findings by research question Findings showed that a confluence of macro and microlevel policy conditions enabled the cuts including declining enrollment budget problems and a negative perception of elementary arts teachers facilitated by permissive teacher certificationassignment policies Analysis also showed that the decisionmaking process was characterized by rival coalitions whose membership was defined by belief systems Based on the findings I offer critical reflection on a number of topics and offer general recommendations as well as implications for researchersThe article presents a story and experience of a young musician

through the course and PCTs gained an appreciation for the subject Despite this PCTs strongly indicated that they are not willing to teach physical education lessons as future teachers They are very willing however to incorporate physical activity into their classroomsPurpose This study described professional development PD among public school physical education PE teachers and compared PE teachers to teachers of other subjects Method Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of public school teachers in the United States Descriptive statistics were used to describe teachers support for PD and the types of PD activities in which they participated Also types of professional support received among newly hired teachers and their perceptions of professional preparation were described Results PE teachers reported fewer PD activities compared to teachers of other subjects They were also less likely to receive release time from teaching and to be financially compensated for PD activities Newly hired PE teachers compared to other newly hired teachers reported higher levels of professional support Discussion Based on the results of this study recommendations are provided concerning support for PD among PE teachers and newly hired PE teachersThere is a growing understanding that teacher education should not be handled either exclusively by the University or in School settings Nevertheless the issues on how to foster a fruitful partnership between these two different institutions remains an open and challenging point The practicum is a critical point in the preservice teachers development usually because it is the first time they have to face the concrete professional issues which they only had a partial view of as students This research is a yearlong inquiry on practicum in the Physics teaching program developed in the Institute of Physics at the University of So Paulo Brazil Drawing on culturalhistorical activity theory contradiction is used as an explanatory principle to examine change and development in the practitioners activity Therefore the research includes in the analytical framework the contradictions and the processes of overcoming it Examples are provided in which there is little control therefore demanding extra efforts but makes room for active participation The data analysis indicates that the source of agency and activities transformation is precisely a contradictory process which might be overlooked The preservice teachers agency is shaped by contradictory process within the activitypracticumrather than aligned forces pushing it toward autonomy student sensitiveness or professional identityThe intent and content of teacher professional learning has changed in recent times to meet the demands of performativity In this article we offer and demonstrate a pragmatic way to map teacher professional learning that both meets current demands and secures a place for teacherled catalytic learning To achieve this we position identified characteristics of performative professional learning on intersecting continua modelled on Bourdieus mapping of social capital which we have called a Pragmatic Model of Teacher Professional Learning The continua are labelled after as domain of influence sphere of action and autonomytransformation While the pragmatic model is illustrated through three examples of teacher professional learning in use in Australia and its characteristics have been drawn from Australian regulatory requirements for teacher registration it will be applicable in other national jurisdictions The model aims to move beyond performativity and to define a systematic and proactive approach for regulators managers professional learning providers and teachers to actively contribute to ongoing innovation and directedness of teacher professional learning toward real student outcomesMany school districts in the United States are facing severe

during the last decade have led to a more inclusive environment for students with different needs and have placed demands on teachers readiness to instruct diverse students in the general classroom Previous research has ascertained that student achievement is correlated with teacher quality and teachers efficacy beliefs Today basic competence in mathematics is more important than ever for managing routine daytoday activities and therefore identifying and educationally supporting students with low performance in mathematics is necessary The aim of the study was to investigate the perceived teacher efficacy beliefs of special education and mathematics teachers when teaching mathematics to lowperforming middle school students Results indicated that special education teachers had higher teacher efficacy beliefs than mathematics teachers Teacher experience certification or gender had no effect on teachers efficacy beliefs Furthermore subject teachers reported high pedagogical knowledge for teaching lowperforming students and special education teachers reported having moderate mathematical subject knowledge PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedInspired by the scarcity of data to support improvement efforts in adult basic literacy programs in the Kaduna State in Nigeria this study investigated the perceptions ofadult basic literacy teachers in service in the state The study was framed by insights from a fourknowledgedomain framework proposed by the American Institute for Research AIR FedeleMcLeod et alan eightdomain framework proposed for ESLEFL settings TESOLand a fourdomain model proposed by Danielson a The purpose was to understandhow the surveyed teachers perceive their readiness to implement the standards proposed by the curriculum as a way of providing empirical data to inform teacher education decisions Beyond teacher perceptions the study also aimed to documentwhether certified teachers perceptions significantly differed from uncertified teachers perceptions andwhether there were statistically significant differences between less experienced and more experienced teachers perceptions In order to reach these goals participants were asked to complete a item survey instrument and multiple choice questions intended to record participant demographics The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics ttests were run to determine the level of statistical significance between certified and uncertified teachers and between less and more experienced teachers The results revealed that theteachers perceive themselves as familiar with and prepared to teach the topics proposed by the Kaduna State Agency for Mass Literacy demonstrate effective teaching practices and actively participate in professional development activities Within such positive perceptions certified teachers showed a higher degree of perceived preparedness than uncertified teachers The overall statistical difference between certified and uncertified teachers were significant However more experienced teachers perceptions did not significantly differ from less experienced teachers perceptions of their preparedness to teach These results encourage continued efforts toward teacher certification collaborative debates on the curriculum content and professional development However further research might need to look closely at what actually happens in Kaduna States basic literacy classrooms in order to better understand and support teachers efforts PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all

of highly qualified teachers particularly in urban school districts is an ongoing concern in education and one not easily solved by investment in recruitment and hiring given that in urban school districts half of the new teachers will leave within three years IngersollSmithDespite evidence of the challenges of teacher retention and attrition many teachers including those in alternative certification programs like TFA decide to remain in the classroom The current study focuses on the experiences ofTFA alumni who are currently in the classroom five or more years beyond their twoyear agreement date Findings from the current study show that participants shared similar experiences to their traditional teacher counterparts However many of their reasons for staying in the classroom were connected to the relationships built with students Participants in the current study also focused on the different relationships formed with other TFA teachers TFA staff and key staff members in their respective schools It is the general recommendation of this study that the training for TFA teachers become more personalized with an emphasis on student relationship building as well as meeting the needs of each new cohort member based on where they are in their career stage These recommendations and other implications for future research and policy recommendations are discussed in detail

receive certification or license to teach Inhowever various alternative certification programs emerged and the number of teachers obtaining teaching certificates through routes other than a traditional teacher preparation program began to plummet In this quantitative study an examination of perceived teaching efficacy was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in traditionally and alternativelycertified teachers A total ofschoollevel principals provided perceptions of teacher efficacy in both certification routes across five domains for evaluating teacher effectiveness Results illustrated that principals believed teachers who were traditionally certified were more effective than teachers who received certification through the alternative routes Significant differences in the principals perceptions of teacher efficacy based on the two types of certifications emphasized the belief that traditionally certified teachers were more efficient in managing the five teaching domains under investigation content knowledge classroom management and instruction instructional planning human relation skills and professionalism PsycINFO Database Record

Program BTAP were positive and whether the new teacher perceptions led to the new teacher remaining in the teaching profession at least five years At the time of this writing in the state of Missouri new teachers must work through a six step process to upgrade their initial teacher certification to a continualyear certification Appendix A This paper describes research on the second step of Missouris process which involved the new teacher working with a mentor for the first two years of their careers to become accustomed to the expectations of a teaching career The method used in collecting data for this was study was threefold First the education department at a local university conducted a new teacher panel discussion The researcher attended this discussion and noted the results within this paper Second secondary data were collected from a conference presentation discussing the perceptions of new teachers and their administrators New teachers gave their responses as to how they thought they were performing in their classrooms and their administrators gave their responses as to how they thought their new teachers were performing Thirdly data was collected online from new teachers and new teacher mentors on their perceptions of the Missouri new teacher mentoring program Results from the data in all three collection methods indicated that while all surveyed districts were using a mentoring process for new teachers each district implemented their program with varying degrees of effectiveness Best practices seemed to indicate that a good new teacher and new teacher mentor personal connection was key to helping new teachers succeed in their new profession The process for how these pairings were created varied from district to district Because of this research the researcher recommends that individual districts make every effort to find a good personal fit between their new teachers and their mentors and that finding this ideal fit is bets performed by the administrator who will be supervising the new teacher and the mentor PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThe purpose of this research was to gain insight into preservice teachers beliefs about play in kindergarten and explore differences in beliefs about play between teachers just beginning their education program and those who are completing their degree The study examined the beliefs of two groups of preservice teachers one at the beginning of their early childhood education program beginning students and one at the end teacher candidates This study used a mixed methods approach including a survey with both Likert scale and openended questions as well as individual interviews Data were collected at the beginning of the fall semester from beginning students and then at the end of that same semester from teacher candidates enrolled in a program preparing them for state teacher certification in early childhood education Quantitative data analyzed through SPSS and SAS to find frequencies descriptive statistics and ttests were used to compare the data generated by the preservice teachers answers Thematic coding was used for gaining insight into the openended responses and interview data Analyses indicated that both beginning students and teacher candidates reported similar beliefs regarding play in kindergarten Comparing responses of these preservice groups revealed subtle yet significant differences between students beliefs about appropriate instructional strategies and evaluation strategies in the kindergarten classrooms Preservice students in this study seemed to have a struggle of balance regarding instructional strategies in kindergarten Individual interviews supported these findings and also gave preservice teachers opportunities to identify influences impacting their beliefs about play in kindergarten In light of these findings this study resulted in several implications for early childhood teacher educators

productive life Mental health disorders among adolescents are prevalent and represent a potential barrier to learning Since most youth attend school regularly these institutions are in a unique position to improve access and availability of mental health services but may not have prioritized mental health due to competing demands placed on the school day and lack of funding andor support for such efforts Federal education policy can shift statelevel support and funding to secondary schools and alter local school and statelevel environments Anticipating the potential impact of such legislation requires an understanding of the relationship between school and statelevel factors and schools implementation of mental health policies and practices Multilevel modeling techniques were

United States excludes a large population of students These exclusions are due to a long history of legal and economic battles as well as the politicized nature of adolescent sexuality This critical interpretive inquiry explored the long history of sexuality education through the lens of economics law and psychological paradigms and examined the way in which each of these lenses furthered the exclusion of nonheterosexual males in curricula Using a framework comprised of critical feminist theory critical pedagogy and queer theory this manuscript provides an understanding of the social structures of sexuality education and how they continue to marginalize students labeled as other Using critical discourse analysis this study reviewed legal and political documents state and private

licensure systems and contexts of art teacher preparation Despite strong relationships between art education policy and practical fields few studies have attempted to understand art education from the perspective of policy analysis This study explores the connections between art education policy and the field of art education through a focus on art teacher preparation in Indiana Additional attention was paid to perceptions of the appropriateness of alternative licensure routes in relation to policies of academic and quality standards and the extent to which visual art teachers sense of identity as teachers and artists is affected by appropriation of these standards The theoretical framework of this study is the need to understand policy appropriation of standards including visual art and art teacher preparation standards as an ongoing process that is continually influenced and changed by internal human level and external institutional level factors The appropriation process is effectively expressed through practices narratives and texts of practitioners To understand the status and factors of the art education policy appropriation in art teacher preparation I collected data as printed or digital documents and as interviews with faculty members and preservice art teachers in two traditional visual art teacher preparation programs in Indiana I analyzed external institutional level and internal human level factors to adopt and work with state and national standards While national standards for visual art education were adopted by many states and presented as voluntary policy in Indiana the national standards were built into the Indianas Academic Standards for Visual Art Standards for K students Visual art teachers were required to complete a traditional teacher preparation program and pass examinations to become licensed to teach art Findings reveal that faculty of higher art teacher education programs in Indiana paid attention to the national and state standards in K visual art and the standards for teacher education when preparing students to become licensed K art educators External motivations were accreditations system for teacher preparation requested by Indiana Department of Education related to NCATE Schools and districts could be external motivations that preservice art teachers adopt the standards in order to succeed in a job market Internal factors were respects of roles and leaders of art education associations desires to trainbe qualified teachers and attain balanced knowledge between art studio and art education Alternative routes to licensure were viewed as economically advantageous but not supportive of highquality education Policy had little impact on issues of identity I concluded with recommendations for improvement in art teacher preparation that were needs of supportive policies for preservice teachers teaching and teaching licensure including traditional and alternative licensures PsycINFO Database

additional supply of teachers beyond those needed to replace departing educators Whether assuming a vacated position or accepting a new one many of these teachers will be new to the profession yet they will be expected to perform all requisite functions of a classroom educator Much debate has transpired concerning the most effective certification route traditional educator preparation or alternative certification paths for securing prepared teachers This study incorporates survey data from campus leaders principals assistant principals and instructional coaches and beginning teachers to evaluate the perceived preparedness of beginning teachers based on certification pathway In aggregate campus leaders perceived traditionally certified beginning teachers to be at least sufficiently prepared in the seven specified areas and overall Most campus leaders found alternatively certified beginning teachers to be at least sufficiently prepared in four of seven areas Generally beginning teachers from both certification pathways perceived themselves as at least sufficiently prepared Additional findings emphasize the value of early field experiences that include a student teaching

of this study was to determine whether there is alignment between postsecondary institutions technology training preparation of teachers and the use of technology in K schools in the State of New Hampshire For the purpose of the study alignment is defined as the correlation of specific technology preparation for teachers to technology utilization in the classroom in order to determine whether training is consistent A mixed methods approach was taken to gain a better understanding of whether alignment exists between technology training of teacher candidates in kindergarten throughth grade K elementary education teacher certification programs in University System of New Hampshire institutions and technology regularly being used to support instruction in K classrooms The results of this study indicate that technology training offor teacher candidates in K elementary education postsecondary teacher preparation programs is occurring at clinical sites during student teaching and field placement and is not embedded in teacher preparation program coursework The examination of technologies teacher candidates are being trained to use revealed that postsecondary institutions are dependent upon field placement sites and supervising teachers to train teacher candidates in the use of technology Technology training is ultimately impacted by availability of technology at individual field sites as well as the knowledge skills and abilities of supervising teachers The reliance on field sites places significant expectations on supervising teachers to provide technology training and support Postsecondary technology training is not based on technology proficiency around devices but on the use of technology as a supplemental tool to effective teaching Alignment of philosophy of technology utilization is discussed and practical implications of the study for postsecondary institutions are considered PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedThis

educating our children Institutions with teacher preparation programs supply a valuable service to their communities by providing classrooms with devoted professionals who thrive on helping children learn and the Teachers College where this study is set is one such institution The Teachers College offers two pathways to gain teacher certification a traditional bachelors degree in teaching areas such as elementary secondary or special education as well as masters degrees in those same teaching areas which offer students with a bachelors degree in an area other than teaching another pathway to teacher certification Many people who receive their bachelor degrees and then return to college to earn advanced K teacher education degrees are from the millennial generation The decision to return to college to earn a masters degree with teacher certification can be a stressful one Millennial students seeking teacher certification often have fulltime jobs and families and therefore need the process of returning to school to be quick and efficient How well these prospective students communicate with the admissions staff at their school of choice will determine if they receive the information needed to complete their applications The focus of this study is to investigate if a proactive advising text message innovation developed for this study called TextEd used during the admission process for graduate level teacher certification programs at the Teachers College affected applicant communication levels and customer satisfaction through the application process More specifically surveys and interviews were conducted with applicants from three teacher certifications programs to determine if TextEd was an effective tool for communication with millennial applicants Results indicated that applicants preferred method of communication was their cell phone and an increased level of customer satisfaction occurred when using a proactive advising approach with text

behavior management skills comparing educators who obtained traditional teacher certification through a universitybased education program and those who obtained alternative certification Consequently the goal of this study was to assess administrator perceptions of teacher effectiveness in managing the classroom and student behavior across four domains By identifying the group with more effective classroom and behavior management skills schoolbased administrators will be able to implement the necessary professional learning to proactively minimize management issues from occurring with future educators as well as close the gap among currently practicing teachers The data were collected frompublic school administrators which was representative of all K public schools in a largesized district The participants contact information was obtained via public email through the district website Additionally the survey participants were guaranteed anonymity and results were reported with no indication of the individuals identity Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data to identify patterns in responses among participants The hypothesis for this dissertation study was that teachers who are alternatively certified are more effective classroom managers than those who have been through traditional universitybased teacher education programs The results showed that administrators perceived teachers who obtained traditional certification were more effective than those who were alternatively certified with nearly half of respondents citing field experience as the key indicator The findings of this dissertation study suggest recommendations for administrators traditionallycertified and alternativelycertified teachers PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights

the past five years According to social learning theory and school climate theory two of the most used theories in education research to explain school achievement school climate factors play an integral role in students school performance Little research is known about whether and how school climate impact academic outcomes of students in rural school districts because most research is limited to urban or inner city school districts The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between the study variables school climate teacher and school demographics and the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test FCAT scores on academic achievement in a rural school district in Florida Secondary data was used from the California School Climate Survey CSCS to measure the perceptions of school climate Teacher demographics certification years of teaching degree held and school demographics discipline attendance and number of students was used to determine if these variables significantly affected academic achievement Multiple regressions were conducted to analyze the data and the results showed that the three variables were statistically significant predictors of academic achievement However getting a higher level degree was not a statistically significant predictor of academic achievement Therefore because of the emphasis on having highly qualified

withinternational teachers from three NIS schools The findings of the study indicate that on the one hand participants share a fascination with the exciting academic environment and on the other hand they report a degree of disaffection as a result of multiple constraints which prevent them from being fully integrated in the life of the schools The article contributes to the literature on teacher mobility and migration examined from the perspective of Bakhtins dialogical approachIn this article we analyze a recent development in educational reform in Kazakhstan which presents interest to researchers of policy transferborrowing We argue not only that international policy transfer has become the main approach to educational reform but also that the approach has been institutionalized by the establishment of a specialized organizational structure represented by a system of flagship institutions at different levels of education which were assigned the role of identifying adapting testing and disseminating the best international practices Reconsidering policy transfer at the organizational level as knowledge transfer we use ideas from interorganizational learning theory to interpret the narrative data from interviews with the employees of the flagships and of the educational organizations to which they disseminate best practices In doing so we attempt to explore the factors which may influence the success of institutionalized policy transfer from brokers to downstream adopters of innovationThis research is a phenomenology study which is one of the qualitative studies that examines the views of school administrators about discipline and disciplinary problemshigh school administrators participated to the research in Kozan district Data collected by interview were analyzed by content analysis method As a result of the study school administrators defined the discipline as responsibility system and order A disciplined school must have the following features everyone fulfills their duties students should be academically successful the educational materials are complete and schools are clean and orderly School administrators listed common disciplinary problems as unfulfilled academic responsibilities at high school the use of harmful substances disobeying the dress code and violence Administrators have associated discipline problems with student characteristics and the attitudes of their families As a result of the research it is seen that the school administrators prompt guidance service classroom teacher and family cooperation in the process of managing the disciplinary problems and they also take care to make interview and guidance work with the students School administrators expectations are that the parents should support the schools decisions and that the discipline regulation in the education system should be updated in accordance with the social conditionsThe purpose of this study was to determine the reflections of authentic taskbased learning environments upon students learning processes and attitudes regarding the course of Life Science In the study which was designed in mixed model the embedded experimental design was used The study was carried out in an elementary school thirdgrade class and conducted in five weeks The research data were collected via the Attitude Scale for Life Science Course

out of class environment undertook multiple roles associated the authentic context with their own lives and made use of experts experiences in real life Besides all it was concluded that the students and their parents generally reported positive views about the use of authentic taskbased learning environments and found the current application effectiveDeciding what degree to study and where are very important decisions to make for a range of practical and economic reasons and much research has been undertaken in this area What has not been considered previously is the decisionmaking processes of students who have completed an associate degree such as a Higher National Diploma or Foundation Degree and are now considering where to complete their Bachelor education Associate degrees are often provided by further education colleges FECs in partnership with universities and the choices available to collegebased higher education students are whether to continue at the college or move to university A mixedmethods approach was adopted comprising of an online questionnaire and subsequent focus groups of students studying at HE at a southwest FEC The findings showed that equal importance is placed on the practical issues of proximity and familiarity as on course suitability with the only differences between those remaining at college and those moving to university being financially basedOver the past decade the number of advertised tenuretrack faculty positions in higher education institutions in the United States and abroad has steadily declined while the competition for these positions has become fierce This situation has caused some scholars to seek perspectives into the factors that influence the tenuretrack faculty selection process This study investigates the elements that impact higher education graduate programme faculty searches A total ofprogramme coordinators department heads and deans who had previously participated in higher education programme searches were surveyed to explore their experiences and perceptions regarding the selection process The findings indicate that the search committees faculty votes within the higher education hiring programme are more influential in selection decisions than the votes of either a programme chair or dean Additionally participants identified a candidates academic accomplishments interview performance and presentation skills as the determining characteristics influencing their selection These findings provide useful information to tenuretrack job seekers who seek faculty positions at higher education graduate programmes in the United States and around the worldDespite the continuing popularity of problembased learning PBL approaches in higher education worldwide concerns have been raised regarding a decrease in effectiveness Unrealistic expectations of students about the nature of learning in a PBL setting may lead to ineffective use of selfregulated learning strategies in turn leading to suboptimal learning during selfstudy In this study we tested the effects of a workshop aimed at aligning students perceptions and expectations of their learning environment to those of the university as expressed in faculty training programs Firstyear PBL medical students were randomly assigned to either a control conditionnor a contrast workshop conditionndesigned to enable them to compare and contrast their expectations to those of the university Results showed no significant differences between conditions in students reported use of SRL strategies but indicated a differential development in students intentions to take responsibility for their own learning with students in the contrast condition reporting an increase in these intentions as a result of the intervention The intervention did not have a differential effect for students with different pretest scores We discuss how optimization of the PBL environment can inform the design of online computerbased support toolsBeing lifelong healthy in all fields and maintaning wellness may not always be possible or easy beacuse of environmental factors including not directly

institutions and the proof for this claim is the increasing use of media contentcomputer games in educational work with children of preschool age Nevertheless the lack of research on the effectiveness of this digital tool binds the pedagogical necessity of carrying out scientific research that will serve as a confirmation of their educational value That exact practice was the initial motive for the realization of the research aimed at examining the attitudes of the preschool teachers on the computer science and technical knowledge and competences necessary for the implementation of computer games in educational work The research involvedpreschool teachers whose attitudes were analyzed in relation to their age years of service place of work and professional education The research was done by the RIUPU instrument scaler specially designed for this research purposes In the presentation of the obtained research results a quantitative approach and a qualitative analysis of the obtained results were used The results of the survey show that the highest percentage of examined educators consider that they possess a solid level of the IT knowledge and that they are able to quickly master the computer software needed for working with children of preschool age The average value of the answers shows that preschool teachers do not have a fully defined image of their IT skills and abilities and that they feel that their studies did not help them prepare for the successful integration of computer games into educational work The results also show that most preschool teachers consider themselves to be successful in the use of technology such as DVD Internet and computers The optimistic outcome of the research is reflected in the fact that the lack of the IT knowledge does not prevent preschool teachers from applying computer games in everyday practice Therefore they are ready for a permanent improvement and mastering modern media tools if it is in the service of the development of preschool age childrenIn the last decade the teaching and learning processes have evolved and adapted in order to take into account the societal changes The fast proliferation of online social networks creates new possibilities to get and share information as well as new opportunities for education The powerful capabilities of the social media technologies make it possible to expand the context of the classroom which is no longer the only place where teaching and learning takes place pupils and students have access at home or anywhere to the teachersupported courses and the support provided by their own colleagues The social networking sites can bring something new to teaching and learning not only in terms of transferring knowledge but also in terms of increased motivation to learn with more familiar and attractive tools The paradigm shift towards social learning brings in front new educational targets such as increased engagement personal and professional development The aim of this research is to take a multidimensional approach in order to explore the new educational opportunities provided by the online social networks in the context of the social learning paradigm The educational opportunities have been specified as a global factor that manifests along four dimensions information opportunities collaboration opportunities personal development opportunities and professional development opportunities The multidimensional model has been tested and empirically validated on two samples of Romanian university students by using the SEM Structural Equation Modeling methodology The results of this study show that the multidimensional model is a better conceptualization having a higher explanatory powerNew learning environments aim to developing abilities and skills for students through the use of information and communication technologies ICT The new strategies for restructuring the higher education system involve continuous improvement of the curriculum and educational programmes in line with the evolution of technology and continually referring to similar institutions in the country regional development and in the European Union Starting with the vision of acquiring indepth knowledge of Geodesy and cadastre in the eLearning System by students or anyone interested an online network was implemented for university collaboration to develop the capacity of providing superior competences in Geodesy mainly for harmonization and standardization of a training program at multiregional level This network constitutes an integrated informatics solution that consolidates existing relationships as well as their expansion between universities businesses and research centres developing at the same time the capabilities of working in collaboration highly acclaimed skill by employers In the present paper the authors present a comparative study regarding the overall results of students development skills acquired theory assimilated progress using eLearning technologies platform mentioned above versus the traditional method The subjects belong to the nd and the th year of study Bachelor cycle as the study also focused on differences between students situated at the beginning of their studies and students that are close to graduation The eLearning platform used represents a smart additional tool to work characterized by efficiency and capacity to adapt and is used successfully sincefacilitating collaboration between sets of graduates students and teachers It allows viewing and managing complex educational content types such as interactive materials tutorials exercises simulations educational games and provides a userfriendly interface for all users both professors and studentsThe paper focuses on the concept of free online education It took overyears for courses sold in America from door to door to reach the stage they are today but the evolution of the latest educational platforms Massive Open Online Courses MOOC was much faster MOOC are courses offered by various entities teachers departments of universities museums institutes that can be attended online by an unlimited number of people Most are free and in addition to video and other teaching materials case studies written explanations they make available platforms for interaction between participants so that they can benefit from discussions with people worldwide The idea of open education has conquered hundreds of educational institutions especially in higher education and adult education institutions worldwide Giving away knowledge for free is a revolutionary idea that attracts students scares publishing houses and challenges educational organizations that see knowledge as a product being their core business A challenge for top universities is to offer the most interesting online courses for free not only as a service to humanity but also as a way of investigating how people learn Some examples of such Romanian platforms are Moocro Unicampusro The paper also presents some foreign online initiatives that have the potential to transform life on Earth Khan Academy a platform founded by Salman Khan one of the pioneers of online education Udacity the latest attempt to make quality education accessible to all Coursera OpenupEd Europeanschoolnetacademy The conclusion of the paper is that online education is not a new concept and is certainly not a completed process The proportions reached in recent years however suggest that there is the chance of emerging economies of many poor communities worldwide but also the sustainable perspective for the future of global education If a few years ago higher education offered by top universities of the planet was just a dream for the vast majority now professors of these institutions teach for free on online platforms Nowadays education through online medium facilitates access to resources once reserved for the elite of the world and also aims to prepare as many employees as possible for the labor market demands of the futureOver the lastyears as a result of the increased communication and collaboration facilities offered by the Web there has been a pronounced worldwide tendency towards making scientific research and its outcomes accessible to society We refer here to the easy access for both researchers and the large public to research results in various toplevel domains such as bio or nanotechnologies drug design or astrophysics as well as to the involvement of nonspecialists in different major research projects in these domains At the same time we observe an exponential growth of Open Educational Resources OER online courses MOOCs books and other materials organized in digital libraries encyclopaedias games and multimedia applications as well as attempts to build a sustainable infrastructure to achieve open education through new pedagogies such as Open Core Courseware Webapproaches blended learning and learning analytics If until recently the accent was set on OERs in the last years the focus shifted towards the Open Educational Practice OEP ie the way in which OERs can be used for teaching and learning in order to innovate the learning process In the long run the sustainability of Open Education OE andor Open Science OS is undoubtedly ensured by a cultural andor behavioural change of societys members especially of the current young generation which will be the researchers or nonspecialized producersconsumers of science in the future In this paper we highlight how we can educate studentsfuture teachers for a world of open science and open education both through the usereusecreate of OERs and the use of OEP as well as raising awareness of the impact of openness on the development of science and the way it is absorbed by societyThe Informational Society has imposed a set of rules on the professionals from various domains but for the information based librarians even a broader set of rules applies Together the diversification of public services the hybrid library and the digital literacy contribute to forming new ways of cultivating professional development Library professionals now have a vast area of attributes to fulfill having to combine both the traditional librarian tasks with the use of the latest technologies and equipment regarding ITC project management trainings sociology or STEM Continuous professional training is one of the attributes of an efficient management Even since hiring it is important to correctly identify an employees skills evaluate them regularly and add new ones through professional training Only highly trained librarians can deliver quality services In this context knowledge management has a fundamental role With its help we can create new collective tools for professional development On the other hand knowledge is based on learning therefore this articles will present the methods through which those concepts can be applied in the Romanian libraries by the use of modern technologies and high quality management of human resources In this articles in order to train good specialists in the Information Science we propose modern elearning and eevaluation models and based on their intrinsic advantages we have them recommended to our associations and to the Library and Information Science education forms but also to the library managers Starting from the existing realities in a library a plan will be presented which will be based on the identification of the skills and abilities necessary for the modern librarian profession Certainly implementing these methods would lead to a greater efficiency in training with much lower costs for institutionsThe present paper aims to analyze the current mission of Carol I Central University Library for library professionals training and development We started our methodology from the services and scientific products that these institutions offer to higher education researchers teachers and students the extent of the technological developments and corelation with the assimilated skills Taking into account the new tendencies in heritage preservation and cultural sharing through the new tech dedicated portals and communication channels library professionals must be specialized in digital technology processing metadata cataloguing bibliographic data exchange digital preservation and data analyzing Unfortunately the Romanian library system lacks a well guided training policy a nationwide unified strategy for digital preservation and also a public strategy for professional training Our study will focus on how Carol I Central University Library Bucharest understands its unique role of training provider for secondary school library system and also of the academic library system The librarian profession addresses to a different public has specific tasks and levels of difficulty being influenced by the organizational evolution and technical infrastructure They are also confronted with economic constraints and need to develop the expertise and adjust the library services and scientific products eBooks eportfolios digital repositories eLearning platforms through electronic means of communication theoretical expertise and sociological tools in order to accomplish the fundamental mission of the institution to support teaching learning and scientific research at highest academic standards The teaching and learning processes have been transformed rapidly the last decades due to the shifting evolution of communication channels and educational software Blended Learning as new paradigm became a very appropriate solution for knowledge transfer The evolution of library services and new strategies for learning and communications required a strong set of specific skills for librarians In this respect having as mission to develop the competences of both academic and school librarians Carol I Central University Library might use a common training curriculum for the basic working skills The purpose of our analysis is to explore the need for blended learning and its influences in the academic environment highlighting the librarians training policies We designed a virtual learning environment dedicated to the professional training with Moodle in order to provide professional guidance for librarians and also applied the last theoretical fundamentals of blending learning in the librarianship field comparative case studies concerning electronic library services In this regard we explored the possible technological foundation that might be used to design a pedagogical model for librarians blended training framework This is the reason behind Carol I Central University Library as the only national training provider for two library systems took into consideration the blended learning as a cost effective solution for knowledge sharing continuous development and professional solidarityThis study focused on primary teachers views of coteaching approaches in addressing the learning needs of pupils with special educational needs SEN in multigrade classrooms in Irish primary schools A case study incorporating a mixed methods approach was chosen Views ofmultigrade and special education teachers SET were ascertained through selfadministered questionnaires and semistructured interviews The findings indicate that while teachers believe the learning needs of pupils with SEN can be met through coteaching approaches the withdrawal of pupils for supplementary support remains the dominant approach Teachers indicate that they would prefer a combination of withdrawal and inclass support as opposed to choosing one approach over the other Teachers refer to the challenges posed by coteaching in delivering instruction for pupils with SEN including planning time teaching personalities and teaching styles in the multigrade context When coteaching does occur the most common form used is station teaching The data demonstrate that teachers lack a clear understanding of the various inclass approaches available and what exactly they entail and point to teachers desire for continuing professional development CPD specific to coteachingTeachers professional development PD receives a great deal of attention in current educational settings However research has shown that

in phenomenology Usingearly childhood teachers from six Caribbean islands as research participants the following study sought to elicit their perceptions of what it takes to be successful in the early childhood classroom and to understand how other early childhood teachers can achieve this Thematic analysis highlights six areasstrong homeschool partnershiptargeted professional developmentmentorship and supportstrong pedagogical practicesappreciation of diversities in the classroom andautonomy These findings suggest that teachers success is not solely dependent on the availability of resources or curriculum requirements Rather the humanness that comes with the profession is perceived to be more important These findings highlight the need to draw on teachers as we aim to address issues of concern in education especially as it relates to the timely issue of improving their competence at the early childhood levelFormative assessment and effective use of data to support student learning are key components of practice in early childhood EC centres Although Trinidad and Tobago has developed an impressive EC care system to decrease the achievement gap which international studies have shown to be significant in core subjects educational planners must ensure that teachers make better use of data This study explored data use practice in eight geographically diverse EC centres Using maximum variation sampling data were collected from focus group teacher interviews observation and document analysis Thematic analysis and constant comparison were used to identify differences across sites and to generate theory on practice The theory identifies data use practice in an emerging Caribbean society lacking a robust data culture and with limited professional development opportunities Implications for policy professional sdevelopment and system reform of the EC sector in Trinidad and Tobago are includedIn Australia as is the case in other countries around the world the Early

challenges for academic libraries The large baby boomer cohort which is approaching retirement needs to be replaced by millennials There are a relatively small number of librarians in the Gen X cohort and in most cases they have come late to leadership opportunities Creating an organization that uses the skills and abilities of all three generations will be challenging and will require attention to both organizational structure and culture It will also require a purposeful focus on leadership development and the provision of opportunities for people throughout the organization so that all can make significant contributions and can meaningfully influence the work and direction of the libraryStrategic planning is a necessary undertaking for many university libraries Through a literature review and an openended exploratory survey to university libraries in Australia Canada New Zealand and United Kingdom the researcher was able to get a sense of nuance and importance of some of the parts of the process Themes include working on the process library staff engagement the timeframe of the plan and process prioritization and focus environmental scanning and university plan alignment This article contains practical applicable information about the planning process Understanding what worked and what did not can help others who are tasked with taking on lead roles in the strategic planning process and can enable libraries to create a strategic plan that works best for their staff users and institutionThe Scottish Mathematics Support Network SMSN was formed in Julywith the aim of creating a support network for people working in Scottish universities who were involved with or wished to be involved with providing mathematical andor statistical support for their students The consensus of the SMSN is that increasingly more students need assistance with their basic mathematical and statistical skills than was the case in the past and that consequently mathematics support is an area on which universities will need to focus on in future years Through networking and professional development opportunities with other practitioners in the field of mathematics and statistics support the SMSN have developed and maintained strong links with individual practitioners and more broadly with likeminded groups such as the sigma Network and the Irish Mathematics Learning Support Network With the provision of mathematics and statistics support becoming more prevalent in UK Higher Education institutions it seemed timely to assess the current state of this provision in Scotland and to compare with the rest of the British Isles At theSMSN AGM it was unanimously agreed that such a study should be carried out with the SMSN committee taking responsibility for conducting the researchGraduate Teaching Assistants GTAs are postgraduate research students who contribute to the teaching of undergraduates while they pursue their own doctoral research This paper reports on a mathematicsspecificlearning hour introduction to teaching for postgraduate mathematics research student GTAs The principles that guided the design of the course are discussed and results from our

understand what trainee counselors who received psychological help were experiencing in the counseling process and how this process was related to their personal and professional development The participants consisted of eight trainee counselors who were fourth graders with two of them being male and six female In order to determine how trainee counselors understand the experience of receiving psychological help the phenomenological design for qualitative research was used and the data was obtained through semistructured interview technique Content analysis was used to analyze the data The findings were organized under the categories of psychological helpseeking process experience of being a client and achievements of receiving psychological help As a result of the study it was found that the trainee counselors realized the need for psychological help and tried to reach resources of professional psychological help While it was comfortable and secure to sit in the counseling chair it was also stressful Also knowing the psychological counseling process influenced their counseling experience and they made some personal and professional achievements during this process Findings are discussed and interpreted in light of literature and some suggestions are presentedBackground For over four decades there have been calls for physical education PE and physical education teacher education PETE to address social inequality and foster social justice Yet as numerous studies demonstrate attempts to educate for social justice in PETE are infrequent and rarely comprehensive This raises the question why it appears to be possible in some situations but not others and for some students and not others Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the multiple sociopolitical networks or assemblages in which PETE is embedded and explore how these shape the possibilities for students to engage with the concept of social justice and sociocultural issues SCI when learning to teach PE Two research questions guided this study How does an orientation for social justice education SJE within education policy affect the standards for enacting PETE programs How is SJE encouraged within PETE programs Methodology Drawing from a broader study of overkey personnel in more thanPETE programs we examined how faculty in PETE understand their professional world identify their subjective meanings of their experiences and address SCI and SJE within PETE Data sources included an initial survey a semistructured interview and program artifacts We analyze the ways that SJESCI was represented in three national settings England the United States and New Zealand and identified common themes Results Examination of each national setting reveals ways that SJE and SCI were enabled and constrained across the national programmatic and individual level in each of the countries The coherence of explicit National policy and curricula PETE program philosophies and the presence of multiple individual interests in social justice served to reify a sociocultural agenda Conversely possibilities were nullified by narrow or general National Standards programs that failed to acknowledge sociocultural interests and the absence of a critical mass of actors with a sociocritical orientation These differences in assemblage culminated in variations in curriculum time that served to restrict or enable the breadth frequency and consistency of the messages surrounding SCI in PETE Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of acknowledging sociopolitical networks where PETE operates The agency of PETEs to enact pedagogies that foreground sociocultural interests is contingent on congruity of the networks The authors caution that although the perfect storm of conditions has a profound influence of the possibility of transformational learning of SCI in PETE this arrangement is always temporary fluid and subject to changes in any of the three network levels Additionally the success of PETE in enabling graduating PE teachers to recognize the inequities that may be reinforced through the hidden curriculum and to problematize the subject area is contingent on the expectations of the schools in which they teachBackground For many years scholars in Physical Education Teacher Educator PETE have argued for the importance of educating preservice teachers

educational backgrounds and courses taught Data analysis was completed using the processes of content analysis and the constant comparative method Corbin J and A StraussBasics of Qualitative Research London Sage Findings Three major themes represent the findings In the first theme Intentional and Explicit Pedagogies we provide descriptions of the approaches and strategies used by PETEs in this study that were planned in advance of the learning experiences In the second theme Teachable Moments we provide examples of how PETEs utilized teachable moments in implicit and explicit ways to educate PSTs about sociocultural issues The third theme Resistance and Constraints captures the individual challenges PETE faculty faced within their courses if and when they teach for equity and social justice The findings suggest that social justice struggles to find an explicit presence within many PETE programs and that educating PSTs about sociocultural issues and social justice is lacking in many PETE programsBackground An emerging body of Physical Education scholarship is addressing the challenge of preparing Physical Education Teacher Education PETE students to enact a

Social History of Curriculum In Defining the curriculum Histories and ethnographies edited by I Goodson and S BallLondon Routledge and the pedagogic acoustics of one HPETE programme Findings HPE teacher educators are serving many masters in order to have programmes accredited whilst also satisfying internal university approval processes and trying to maintain the philosophical integrity and some sense of ownership over HPETE programmes Students are often unaware of the nonnegotiables that have come to define andor limit how teacher educators teach towards social justice and facilitate democratic engagement and therefore are sometimes critical of the disconnect between the walk and talk of teacher educators The medium is the message was one of the strongest themes to be constructed from the data set as all participants agreed that certain institutional and policy arrangements pedagogical decisions and styles of communication were a large part of what was taught and learned about

structured training course for critical care physiotherapy and its effects on the knowledge and skills of the participants in Sri Lanka a lowermiddle income country Methods The twoday program combining short didactic sessions with small group workshops and skills stations was developed and delivered by local facilitators in partnership with an overseas specialist physiotherapist trainer The impact was assessed using prepostcourse selfassessment prepostcourse multiplechoicequestion MCQ papers and an endofcourse feedback questionnaire Results Fiftysix physiotherapistsof critical care physiotherapists in Sri Lanka participated Overall confidence in common critical care physiotherapy skills improved fromtoin preposttraining selfassessments respectively Postcourse MCQ scores mean score and percentage of passeswere higher than precourse scores mean score percentage of passes Overall feedback was very positive asof the participants were highly satisfied with the courses contribution to improved critical care knowledge Conclusions This short structured critical care focused physiotherapy training has potential benefit to participating physiotherapists Further it provides an evidence that collaborative program can be planned and conducted successfully in a resource poor setting This sustainable short course model may be adaptable to other resourcelimited settingsAn introduction is presented to the articles published within the issue on topics including strengthening professionalism through cooperative learning selfknowing within narrative practices for teacher educators and effect of a professional development on early childhood educatorsThis article focuses on the processes that come into play as part of a school development project and how these processes contribute to strengthening teacher professionalism Through processes of consciousness raising and the development of learning cultures where tacit knowledge becomes explicit and shared and new practices are tested out and discussed teacher professionalism is developed further The study shows that this kind of school development work gives the teachers ownership of the development process and strengthens their consciousness about their own teaching as well as develops the learning cultures at the school Thus this development becomes an important way in which to reinforce the teachers professional knowledge responsibility and autonomyIdentity transformation from teacher to teacher educator is problematic as an expert become novice The need for professional development for neophyte teacher educators is accepted The focus of such professional learning has been on the development of an academic identity and engaging in research the transition in identity is assumed to follow This study used an adapted form of Professional Life History which is shown to support their identification with the new role Analysis showed a process of identification within the context of the focused storytelling The study demonstrates that specific narrative practices can be utilised to support neophyte teacher educators in developing their personal and professional identity as a teacher educatorResearch over the last years has reported that for professional development to be effective in terms of changing teachers knowledge andor instructional strategies it needs to be conducted taking into consideration the following factors teachers existing knowledge experience and attitudes towards the professional development school administrative factors opportunities for classroombased followup and gathering data concerning student achievement to measure the impact or effectiveness of the professional development These factors were all carefully considered when creating planning and implementing the professional development model for this study The results indicate that an evidencebased professional development model which included a workshop classroom observations and coaching significantly improved participants instructional practice over the course of one year while implementing Lets Decode a semiscripted explicit and direct approach to teaching phonological awareness and systematic decoding instruction when teaching beginning readingThe importance of the principals role in improving student learning outcomes has been acknowledged however there is global concern about the availability of appropriate professional learning for principals This article explores the impact on host principals of a shadowing and mentoring intervention designed to prepare New Zealand aspiring principals for secondary school principalship It discusses the findings from the qualitative evaluative study that aligns with constructivist paradigm and suggest that the intervention was a vehicle for professional learning for the experienced principals who were shadowed and who mentored the aspiring principals The nine host principals who were interviewed believed that the intervention was a reciprocal one that reduced their isolation stimulated critical reflection on their leadership actions encouraged them to view their school culture through a new lens and improved connectivity between schools As such it provided access to highly relevant professional development in their own context through dialogue with a professional colleague It is recommended that shadowing and mentoring be considered an effective approach to meet the needs of experienced principalsIn Ghana research has shown that educational reforms over the years have ignored the importance of school leadership development and there are currently very few reform initiatives that address the need to develop the leadership proficiencies and skills of school leaders This study sought to investigate how school leaders who include headteachers assistant headteachers and form masters in such contexts develop their leadership skills following their appointment into their new roles A mixedmethods approach was employed in gathering both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently from three groups of leaders in the basic schools of one rural educational district in Ghana Results from the study showed that the professional development activities PDAs that the leaders employed for their development were mostly informal and selfdirected learning methods There were only limited formal leadership development programmes for the leaders working within any of the rural district basic schools represented in the study The study concludes that to strengthen school leadership in basic schools in the selected district educational authorities would need to learn from international best practice to initiate sustainable PDAs to strengthen the leadership capacities of leaders to promote effective teaching and learning in schoolsWhile research in teacher professional development PD has focused on numerous topics not much is known about how teachers understand the notion of PD Studying this topic is important because for PD to be effective all parties involved in its design and implementation need to have a common understanding of the scope and purposes of PD We askedSingapore primary school music teachers to define PD using their own words Descriptive statistics cluster analysis and crosstabulations were used to analyze the definitions and the extent to which these differed according to certain demographic variables We found that teachers definitions were not entirely consistent with those proposed in the educational literature as teachers referred to a narrower scope of ideas regarding the content facilitation type format and outcomes of PD For example while the ultimate goal of PD according to scholarly definitions is enhancing student learning teachers seem to primarily understand PD as a means to improving themselves No differences were identified when teachers definitions were compared according to variables such as age teaching experience designation and specialization Based on our findings we conclude that it is essential to help teachers develop broader understandings of what PD means and entailsThe interpretive survey study reported in this paper aimed to understand inservice English language teachers views of inservice teacher education INSET programmes offered by the Ministry of National Education in Turkey Data were collected frominservice teachers through an online questionnaire that contained closed and openended items Central tendencies were calculated and content analysis was used to analyse quantitative and qualitative data respectively According to the findings participants disagreed about the effectiveness of these programmes They reported that these programmes were effective in terms of promoting their professional development personal development and cooperation between colleagues however issues emerged regarding the weaknesses of these programmes in six main areas the limited number of programmes on offer the lack of qualified trainers insufficient practical focus poor lecturing inconvenient time and place and the perfunctory nature of the INSET offered In the light of these findings implications are generated to contribute to the improvement of the effectiveness of future inservice teacher education programmesA Performance and Development Framework has been introduced by the New South Wales Department of Education the largest provider of schooling in Australia during a period of unparalleled reform Engagement with the Framework is mandatory for all the Departments teachers and is linked to improving student outcomes through enhanced teacher professional practice As an initial study of the efficacy of the Performance and Development Framework this article reports a study of teachers understandings of professional learning arising from the first year of the Frameworks implementation Five teaching staff from one school were interviewed three times during the school year to elicit insights into their professional development during experience of the new system Three themes emergedlonger serving teachers and less experienced earlycareer teachers view the professional learning differentlyall the teachers considered the Performance and Development Framework to be a positive developmentalthough there was an uptake of reflective practice understanding of critical reflection as linked to professional learning was limited The study concludes that this mandatory professional development process was generally successful in this context while there is scope for further enhancement specifically in relation to guiding content and reflective practiceThe purpose of this research was to investigate secondary teachers perceptions of professional development Results indicated that although teachers perceive professional development as a tool for learning teacher leadership data analysis and collaboration are needed to increase its effectiveness Results of teachers perceptions may be used to improve professional development practices in other school districts in the USA or in similar international contextsBackground For the past decade science educators have been exploring the use of Socioscientific Issues SSI as contexts for science teaching and learning and research indicates that doing so can support significant learning gains However research related to how teachers take up the practice of SSIbased instruction is far more limited due in part to a lack of tools for use in this kind of research Purpose The focus of this research is development and testing of a new classroom observation protocol specifically designed for SSIbased instructional contexts Design and methods Development of this SSIObservation Protocol SSIOP took place in four distinct phases review of existing protocols and SSIbased instruction frameworks writing and revision of protocol items initial testing of the draft protocol and soliciting feedback from SSI experts Sample Following the four stages of SSIOP development we progressed to a series of field tests The field tests were conducted with three different samples The first sample was an experienced years high school biology teacher and one of her honors biology classes The second sample consisted of seven Turkish Preservice Science Teachers PST participating in a science methods course The third sample included two Thai PST from a field experience course embedded within a teacher education program Results The final version of the protocol addressed five dimensions of SSIbased instructional activities focus of instruction teaching moves role of teacher role of students and classroom environment Conclusions The SSIOP could be used in a variety of ways for research including documentation of current practices impacts of professional development andor curricula on teaching practices and changes in teaching over time We offer the SSIOP as a new tool with the potential to contribute to science teacher education and research that may advance the teaching and learning of science through SSIResearch has shown that in Germany language skills differ greatly already at the preschool age There is therefore a strong need for highquality language education in institutional early childhood education and care The fact that Early childhood education and care quality has been shown to be rather low calls for implementing evidencebased strategies for effectively improving languagerelated process quality the burden of which falls heavily on early childhood professionals Identifying supporting conditions for their work is therefore a major concern The present study explores the extent to which professional exchange is related to the development of languagerelated process quality while controlling for variables of structural quality Data fromchildcare centres from the evaluation study of the federal programme Core Daycare Centres for LanguageIntegration was used Structural background variables and the index of professional exchange were included in regression models to predict the development of languagerelated process quality Professional exchange was positively associated with the development of languagerelated process quality The conclusion of this study is that regular professional exchange within the team on the topic of language education contributes significantly to developing quality in childcare centresRecent research has shown that caregiver education and training can be important in determining levels of quality in early childhood but has mainly considered the education and training of the lead teacher In infant child care however classrooms have more than one caregiver with varying levels of education and in Portugal it is less common to have a qualified teacher exclusively assigned to infant classrooms This study examines the quality of caregiverchild interactions in infant classrooms and its association with caregiver qualifications and training specifically the level of preservice education and inservice training of the lead caregiver whether she is exclusively assigned to an infant classroom or to more classrooms and the preservice education of the multiple caregivers in the classroom Participants wereinfant classrooms from Porto Portugal The CLASSInfant was used to measure quality of caregiverinfant interactions Classrooms with one lead caregiver holding at least a bachelors degree whether exclusively assigned to the infant classroom or not showed higher levels of quality Few effects were found for inservice training Results suggest that lead teachers with preservice education in early childhood are likely to play an important role not only directly by interacting with children but also indirectly through team workCore competencies in youth work refer to demonstrated capacities of quality performance that allow youth development workers to be resources for the young people organizations and communities with whom they work While a number of practice frameworks based on core competencies have been developed few validated assessment measures exist to help identify professional development needs for youth workers This article describes the adaptation and psychometric validation of a core competency assessment tool for youth work practitioners in Malaysia A quantitative study was undertaken to validate an adapted core competency measure with a sample ofMalaysian youth workers Psychometric validation included both internal consistency and construct convergent and discriminant validity tests Confirmatory factor analysis yieldedcore competency subscales Adequate internal consistency was achieved for each subscale along with the full measure The findings support the validity and reliability of the core competency measure Recommendations for application and further research are discussedIn the context of an ongoing project emphasising the centrality of speaking and listening in the primary curriculum the present article turns to vocabulary development to the wide differences characterising primary age children in this regard to their consequent unequal access to the wider curriculum and to means by which such deficiencies may be addressed This article reports how given a variety of inservice supports teachers in a small group of schools undertook to define relevant aims and objectives and to include a range of appropriate approaches in their teaching Particular emphasis was placed upon active and explicit vocabulary instruction The viability and effectiveness of the strategies employed were assessed through analysis of a range of collected data numerous examples of which are presented and evaluated here This article concludes by reviewing such matters from teachers as well as pupils perspectives and by emphasising the role of explicit instruction within the various approaches discussedThis review of the literature offers an analysis of ways in which the theory and pedagogical concepts of cosmopolitanism have been employed across research in adult education contexts Twentynine research articles and dissertations on cosmopolitanism and adult education conducted in various geographical locations and adult education contexts were selected for the analysis The article presents how researchers define and theorize cosmopolitanism the purposes for using cosmopolitanism tenets in the studies and conclusions that the findings proffer about cosmopolitanism for adult learning teaching and continuing and professional development The review concludes with implications for practice and future researchWritten tests for selection into medicine have demonstrated reliability and there is accumulating evidence regarding their validity but we know little about the broader impacts or consequences of medical school selection tests from the perspectives of key stakeholders In this first Australian study of its kind we use consequential validity as a theoretical lens to examine how medical school students and applicants view and experience the Graduate Medical Schools Admission Test GAMSAT and the consequences of testing Participants n were recruited from five graduateentry medical schools across Australia and a publicly available online test preparation forum An online survey was used to gather demographic information and quantitative and qualitative data Quantitative data were analysed via descriptive statistics and qualitative data were thematically analysed The findings showed there was a considerable financial burden associated with preparing for and sitting the GAMSAT and moderate agreement regarding the GAMSAT as a fair selection method The main unintended consequences of using the GAMSAT as a selection tool included barriers related to test affordability and language and socialisation into the hidden curriculum of medicine Selection tools such as the GAMSAT have some limitations when the goals are to support equitable participation in medicine and professional identity development Our study highlights the value interpretive and theoreticallyinformed research in contributing to the evidence base on medical school selectionInsufficient professional development may lead to poor performance of healthcare professionals Therefore continuing education CE and continuing professional development CPD are needed to secure safe and good quality healthcare The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesized associations and their directions between pharmacists basic psychological needs in CE their academic motivation wellbeing learning outcomes Selfdetermination theory was used as a theoretical framework for this study Data were collected through four questionnaires measuring academic motivation basic psychological needs BPN vitality and lifelong learning adaptability of pharmacists in the CECPD learning context Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data Demographic factors like gender and working environment influenced the observed scores for frustration of BPN and factors like training status and working experience influenced the observed scores for academic motivation A good model fit could be found only for a part of the hypothesized pathway Frustration of BPN is positively directly related to the less desirable type of academic motivation controlled motivationand negatively directly related to vitalityand negatively indirectly related to learning outcomes in CE Fulfillment or frustration of BPN are important predictors for wellbeing and learning outcomes Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating vitalizing and sustainable CECPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals Basic psychological needs are very important predictors for wellbeing and learning outcomes Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating vitalizing and sustainable CECPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionalsITC technologies have come to comprehensively represent images and expectations of the future Hopes of

studies have examined teachers natural use of praise and no study has examined the relation between teachers natural use of praise and classroom behavior The purpose of the current study was to examine general education teachers natural use of praise in elementary classrooms One hundred forty direct behavioral observation hours were used to collect praise rates and student behavior acrossgeneral education classrooms kindergarten to fifth grade Across all grade levels results suggest that teachers use of praise was low gradelevel mean rates ranging fromper minute in the fourth grade toper minute in kindergarten and teachers used general praise more frequently than behaviorspecific praise BSP A significant negative relation was found between offtask behavior and BSP r p

Complexity science perspectives have helped in examining fundamental assumptions about learning and teaching in the health professions The implications of complexity thinking for how we understand the role and development of the clinical educator is less well articulated This review article outlines the key principles of complexity science a conceptual model that situates the clinical educator in a complex system and the implications for the individual organisation and the system Key findings Our conceptual model situates the clinical educator at the centre of a complex and dynamic system spanning four domains and multiple levels The four domains are personal encompassing personalprofessional needs and expectations health services health agencies and their consumers educational educational institutions and their health students and societal local communityregion and government The system also comprises micro or individual meso or organisational and macro or sociopolitical levels Conclusion Our model highlights that clinical educators are situated within a complex system comprising different agents and connections It emphasises that individuals teams and organisations need to recognise and be responsive to the unpredictability interconnectedness and evolving nature of this system Importantly our article also calls for an epistemological shift from faculty development to capacity building in health professions education aimed at developing individual team organisational and system capabilities to work within complexity Clinical educators are situated within a complex system comprising different agents and connectionsSummary Background Most doctors are not observed in the actual practice of medicine after they complete training Direct observation and feedback are seen as invaluable in learning in most other professions at formative stages of medical training and in other aspects of academic medicine yet are not performed at the level of the independently practicing clinician Creating an opportunity for faculty member development based on observation of clinical practice is needed for continued growth and competence as a clinician Methods Independently practicing clinicians within our practice volunteered to both observe and be observed by a colleague in clinical practice and then both give and receive feedback Pairs of clinicians with similar experience levels were created The person being observed set the ground rules for feedback to promote a safe environment Results Most respondents found both observing and being observed useful comfortable experiences which were better than most other continuing professional development CPD initiatives Both observing and being observed seemed to lead to reflection on practice and a change in practice by most participants Most respondents would like to participate again Both observing and being observed seemed to lead to reflection on practice Discussion Next steps include expanding the programme within our group and to other departments within our institution There is potential to use this programme as a model for CPD credit An intradepartmental programme in which participants receive CPD credit for the observation of their practice of medicine could meet the primary goal of CPD ensuring doctors are competent and continue to develop in an efficient meaningful and costeffective wayMeasuring training outcomes is important given the resources universities invest in staff learning management system LMS training In this paper we show how the effect of LMS training on LMS usage can be evaluated using Rasch analysis of teachers LMS usage activity logs by making comparisons between teachers who have attended training and those who have not Our analysis showed that teachers who attended LMS training workshops had higher LMS activity level compared with the untrained teachers In particular trained teachers tended to make relatively more use of grade centre and of assessment tool but relatively less use of content in their teaching compared with teachers who did not attend training The results support Rasch analysis as a useful approach for evaluating the effect of training across a large number of courses and extend understanding from findings from selfreport studies of training effectiveness They also provide insights that inform training practice and highlight its importance for development of online teaching Implications for professional development of online teaching and the evaluation are discussedThe use of technology to support learning is becoming ubiquitous in Africa However technology is more often used to distribute information rather than as a tool to mediate learning The work presented here on a programme for Zambian community school teachers nontraditional students illustrates how learning design allied to appropriate theoretical concepts make use of technology to mediate learning The objective of this course was to support Zambian community school teachers with little formal teacher education to use interactive methods to support their teaching practices The research makes use of a constructivisthermeneuticinterpretivistqualitative paradigm to critically evaluate the learning design by experts A social constructivist framework for learning design and technology mediation was used to create and evaluate learning resources The work illustrates how a distance education paperbased course design is enhanced by the use of contemporary learning theory and digital technology to model good interactive classroom practiceResearch Findings Children learn most of their vocabulary incidentally by hearing words used in their environment This study explored which kinds of

efficacious coaching strategies eg observation and discussion more frequently than coaching strategies demonstrated to be more efficacious eg modeling and coteaching Practice or Policy Our findings suggest an explanation for the mixed evidence around coaching as coaches in the study seemed to move beyond the specifications of the PD in their coaching interactions This work has implications for the design of PD for both improving coach training and allowing some flexibility to meet educators learning needs that may be secondary to the content of the PD Findings also support the need for more nuanced mechanisms for investing in coaching and coaching outcomesThe scientist practitioner model SPM or Boulder Model emphasizes training in research methods and the application of research findings to solving clinical problems Within the science of applied behavior analysis ABA the scientistpractitioner model SPM is an integral component of the field However there are no data to report on the current state of the SPM within our field A survey was administered among current Board Certified Behavior Analysts BCBAs to evaluate the current state of the SPM and research productivity We also evaluated BCBAs motivations for research involvement the number of publications per respondent and other important variables impacting research productivity Overall results indicate that the majority of respondents adhere to the SPM despite the lack of high research productivity Suggestions on bridging the gap and possible future directions are discussedIndividuals with autism may engage in problem behavior in order to escape aversive stimuli including various noises In this study an year old young man with autism had a history of engaging in problem behavior to escape aversive noise that was typical to his everyday environment By using biofeedback in the form of heart rate measurement an effective treatment package was developed The treatment was effective in reducing the participants heart rate and arousal levels which in turn led to successful habituation to the environmentPurpose To advance a framework of indicators that promotes implementation of math standards under the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA we tested a conceptual model of the resources and processes within schools that influence the opportunity to learn mathematics OTL in the classroom using a recent administration of theTrends in International Math and Science Study TIMSSThere is potential benefit to state departments and systemlevel practitioners from more information about how schools might influence student access to college and careerready curriculum Such information has the potential to shape the kinds of indicators stakeholders put in place to target problems and formulate solutions for math learning Research Design To test the fit of our hypothesized model of math content and instruction OTL we applied structural equation modeling techniques to school and classroom data fromfourthgrade US math teachers in TIMSSFindings We found a direct influence of instructional leadership on OTL math instruction in the classroom and teacher participation in math professional development Contentspecific resources indirectly influenced both OTL math instruction and content through teacher preparedness Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate a potential framework through which school leaders can support the preparedness of teachers in providing students with equitable access to coherent focused and rigorous math contentPurpose This article focuses on the role of school and district leadership in the development and implementation of reform aimed at increasing racial and religious tolerance It chronicles the rise of intercultural and democratic citizenship curriculum in three North American sitesSpringfield Massachusetts Kirkland Lake Ontario and San Diego Californiaduring the s Research Method Parallel historical case studies were conducted using traditional historical research methods through the analysis of archival documents school district memos school board minutes and contextualization through relevant secondary source literature Findings School and district leaders supported curriculum innovation aimed at prejudice reduction and propaganda analysis networked and collaborated with community organizations and used foundation funding to support curriculum and professional development for racial and religious inclusion Implications These cases highlight the critical role of leadership to support democracy in the development of partnerships between school and district personnel community activists and civic foundations the establishment of advocacy networks across borders and the borrowing of diversity policies from other school districts which were adapted to their unique community contexts This historical study has implications for how current school leaders might lead for democracy in challenging timesScholars in different fields have theorised about the value of narrative learning and narrative education for advancing components of civic professional and worldview development Whilst research into the theory and practice of narrative learning is more widespread in adult and religious education it is still scarce in the area of democratic citizenship education This article reports a theoretical social scientific inquiry into the key characteristics of narrative democratic citizenship education After defining the key elements of narrative learning and the educational philosophy this study is based on it elaborates on four modes of narrative learning in democratic citizenship education learning from narratives learning in the process of narrating learning by recognising personal and cultural narratives and learning by locating these narratives It then illustrates how each mode of narrative learning can contribute to advancing democratic citizenship identity and cultural narratives on good citizenship and the good society Building on this framework and the work of educational researchers who specialise in civics or narrative learning the article concludes with a discussion of the desirability of employing narrative learning to cultivate citizenship identity in formal educationTraditional conceptions of teaching are being challenged as many schools especially in New Zealand and Australia are designing and implementing multiclass flexible learning environments These deprivatised innovative learning spaces provide opportunities for teachers to work differently in collaborative coteaching teams to collectively address diverse learners needs This mixed method study investigates the perspectives of teachers and principals experiences of transitioning to a coteaching environment and highlights some of the emerging opportunities and challenges that leaders face in supporting teachers to work effectively in these collaborative contexts While leading the transition requires vision and provision of organisational resources the findings endorsed the need for professional learning and development to equip teachers to work together effectively with a strong focus on improving student outcomesAbstract Introduction Recent developments in European dental education are studentfocused concerned with competencybased and problembased learning The development of dental educators has so far received little consideration This study aimed to agree curriculum content for developing dental educators so that they are better able to support changing undergraduate dental education Methods Adopting consensus methodology a round Delphi was conducted inFiftythree dental educators anddental students across Europe volunteered to take part The Delphi questionnaire was developed based on literature piloted and sent to participants to gather opinions and seek consensus on educational content using rating scales and openended questions Numeric data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed thematically Results and Discussion This study revealeddomains of curriculum content for dental educators Four of these domains were considered essential educational principles educational practice in dentistry curriculum quality and improvement and educational professionalism Three domains were viewed as optional and could be tailored to local needs educational principles in relation to specific contexts educational research and educational and healthcare management When developing training for dental educators factors which need consideration were identified as the academic position and teaching experience of educators and the nature of clinical dental education Conclusion The results are beneficial for individual educators to inform professional development plans institutions to devise faculty developments ADEE to inform policies on developing European dental educators and other disciplines to inform training for their educatorsAbstract Introduction The UK General Dental Council stipulates that professionalism is a key aspect of the teaching and training of dental students However dental educators highlight that teaching dental students professionalism can be challenging and students often rate this teaching activity negatively This article documents a teaching initiative at one UK Dental School that aimed to strengthen the professionalism curriculum by introducing a Dental Scrubs Ceremony for secondyear students Materials and method The Dental Scrubs Ceremony is inspired by the White Coat Ceremonies that medical students have in universities in North America It marks the students first step in their professional and clinical development with the signing of a pledge of conduct and public presentation of dental scrubs to each student We report student feedback questionnaire data over a threeyear period together with reflections on the merits and limitations of this alternative approach to teaching professionalism Results Student evaluation data show that the perceived usefulness and worthwhileness of a Dental Scrubs Ceremony have grown since its inception inMost students enjoyed the symbolism of the ceremony receiving their dental scrubs in a formal event However there was mixed evaluation for its effectiveness to teach professionalism Conclusion A Dental Scrubs Ceremony is a useful addition to the formal curriculum of professionalism in a dental school It provides dental students with an opportunity to be inducted into the dental profession as novice dental students starting out on their professional careerThe impact ofandradiation on antioxidant depletion in smooth highdensity polyethylene HDPE geomembranes GMs is described Smooth HDPE GMs having different thickness mm mm mm were created by mechanically pulverizing sections of mmthick smooth HDPE GM and extruding the polymer at different thicknesses using a film blowing machine The mmthick smooth HDPE GM was also used in the experiments HDPE GM specimens were exposed to sealed sources ofAm andTc for h to simulate the impact ofandradiation from U andTc in lowlevel radioactive waste LLW leachate Standard oxidative induction time OIT tests were conducted to determine antioxidant depletion No change in OIT occurred in the mmthick HDPE GM after exposure to sealed sources ofAm andTc for h In much thinner GMs eg mm however significant antioxidant depletion occurred after exposure most likely due to penetration ofandparticles Penetration depth ofandparticles and dose deposition in HDPE GMs were estimated with the GEometry ANd Tracking GEANT program Predictions from GEANT show that maximum dose deposition occurs at the surface of the HDPE GM and decreases with depth A multilayer model is used to estimate antioxidant depletion in HDPE GMs for depthdependent doses These estimates suggest that radiation from LLW leachate has an insignificant effect on antioxidant depletion in HDPE GMs due to the low dose deposition eg Gy expected over a yr service life even if the level of activity in LLW leachate increases x to x the level typical of todayProviding health care services has always been considered as a hazardous job due to a number of reasons The risk of bloodborne viruses and the importance of their prevention has led to the formulation of principles called standard precautions SPs The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of an educational intervention based on the Health Belief Model constructs on the behavior of nurses in emergency centers regarding observing SPs in Sirjan Iran This was a quasiexperimental study The study population includedemergency personnel working in health centers in Sirjan city of Iran who were randomly divided into two intervention n and control n groups The educational intervention was conducted over two sessions each lasting formin Information was collected by a questionnaire withquestions completed in an interview conducted directly before the intervention andmonths later Data were analyzed using the test t test and paired t testThe results showed nurses did not have enough information about SPs but after the intervention knowledge scores increased in both groups In the Health Belief Model HBM constructs significant differences were observed in perceived susceptibility perceived severity perceived benefits and barriers cues to action and selfefficacy after the intervention in the intervention group P but not in the control group P HBM was effective in educating SPs among emergency personnelPurpose Leaders in education face diverse challenges in an increasingly competitive and changing environment Although women numerically dominate the workforce senior managers are predominately men The purpose of this paper is to examine leadership skills required for senior management roles in vocational education training VET determine if the ranking of importance of skills differs by gender and if the ranking contributes to women not advancing to senior management roles As skills are abilities that can be developed and learned focusing on leadership skills will provide further insight into leadership and influence leadership development programs in VET to reorientate women into senior management rolesDesignmethodologyapproach The methodology was based on the theoretical framework of the Leadership Skills Strataplex Model LSSM The model categorises leadership skills into cognitive interpersonal business and strategic skills and determines skill requirement based on management level A quantitative study with data collected from an online survey completed bysenior managers employed in Australian VET with an even distribution of men and women identified leadership skills and ranked the importance of the skills Analysis of the data was conducted using correlation test and principal factor analysisFindings Both men and women identified that cognitive interpersonal business and strategic skills were required for senior management roles in VET however they ranked the importance of these skills differently Men ranked business and strategic skills as the most important whilst women ranked cognitive and interpersonal skills The findings provide insight into how gender influences leadership with men focused on taskorientated leadership skills whilst and women focused on relationship development leadership skillsResearch limitationsimplications The major limitation of this study was that the results were derived from the employees perspective and not that of the employer However the limitation does not detract from the overall contribution this study makes to leadership leadership skills and VET The findings of this study suggest that further education leadership research is warranted as most studies are predominately focused on leadership theory with limited reference to leadership skillsPractical implications The findings of this study provide practical implications to inform VET leadership professional development programs for teachers and managers to focus on leadership skills The difference in ranking of importance of leadership skills by men and women highlights that focusing on specific leadership skill development of cognitive interpersonal business and strategic skills for aspiring managers may help reorientate women into senior management rolesOriginalityvalue The use of the LSSM previously used in government and higher education to identify leadership skills the online survey as the data collection tool and quantitative analysis provides originality in the methodology rarely seen in VET education The study adds value to education management VET leadership and gender research by providing insight into leadership skillsPurpose The purpose of this paper is to bare the peculiarities and challenges of the dual training DT of the future primary school teachers in the Republic of Kazakhstan The abovementioned problem is quite urgent as the system of VET and DT is a rather new experience for Kazakhstani system of higher education Thereby the paper makes an effort to demonstrate the forms of organization of DT at teachers training universityDesignmethodologyapproach The instruments for gathering information data for this study were various primary school teachers training curricula adopted by Kazakh State Womens Teacher Training University in particular curricula of teaching practice Various types of teaching practice during the entire learning period are provided by the state educational standards of higher professional education Therefore the research utilized a retrospective analysis that allows identifying the nature and specifics of the primary school teachers training curriculaFindings The paper points out the necessity to strengthen practical orientation of future primary school teacher through the synthesis of academic and educational processes in school It also presents the differences between the organization of teaching practice based on traditional and dual approachOriginalityvalue The authors suggest project curriculum of continuous teaching practice during the entire learning process on the example of the specialty B Pedagogy and methodology of primary education in the context of DT and some results of its implementationThe lack of diversity in the teaching profession is recognised internationally Schleicher A Equity Excellence and Inclusiveness in Education Policy Lessons from around the World Paris OECD Research shows consistently that teachers from majority socioeconomic and ethnic groupings dominate often in contrast to school populations While studies in the USA and the UK have shown that teachers with disabilities are significantly underrepresented compared to the general population there has been a dearth of research in this area in Ireland including in relation to initial teacher education ITE Following a review of the literature and an overview of the studys methodology we present findings exploringITE applicants and entrants with respect to their disability status and intersections with other sociodemographic variables based on data gathered in the Diversity in Initial Teacher Education in Ireland national research project establishing the first national dataset about disability in Irish statefunded ITE While we identified increases in the proportion of disabled students entering ITE especially at postgraduate level applicants with disabilities were significantly less likely to be accepted into undergraduate primary ITE than were those without and there was considerable variation in the proportions from different categories entering ITE We end by discussing the significance and implications of our findings in terms of practice policy and further researchMany universities offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses in inclusive education There has been much research into the impact of these courses but little is written about their design This article focuses on a masters course in inclusive education in a South African university The course positions inclusive education as a critical education project and is designed around the four propositions presented by Slee in The Irregular SchoolMilton Park Routledge Using Bernsteinian ideas about pedagogising knowledge this article accounts for the pedagogical choices made in content selection and course design The focal questions in the course are described together with an indication of the range of additional texts that students read Given that Slee asserts that inclusive education is a political project and that AllanThe Inclusive Teacher Educator Spaces for Civic Engagement Discourse Studies in the Cultural Politics of Educationurges inclusive teacher educators to reorientate themselves towards civic duty I argue that producing a pedagogic discourse of inclusive education is a political task that should result in both the teacher educator and the students being oriented towards a critique of existing exclusionary arrangements and an activism that leads to changeThis article analyses the role of the cooperation with and the influence of the Nordic countries on the development of a democratic society in Lithuania through adult education since the reinstatement of its independence from Soviet regime in Marchto the present The authors focus on three main areasthe training of Lithuanian adult educatorsthe establishment and development of NGOs andthe implications for a Lithuanian policy of adult education Within the framework of NordicBaltic cooperation established among five Nordic and three Baltic countries NB inLithuanian adult educators seized the opportunity to visit Scandinavian institutions and projects Experiencing Nordic adult education ideas has resulted in a marked shift in Lithuanian adult educators values methodology and careers and in the establishment of a series of very influential umbrella associations as well as hundreds of NGOs in Lithuania which work with adults and support functioning democratic values in society This shift is related to the civic responsibility and active participation growing out of the bottomup approaches of group work cooperation discussions and learning circles which are so inherent in the Nordic tradition of adult education The internalisation of new democratic values was more complicated than expected for many Lithuanian politicians adult educators and NGO leaders in terms of how political decisions were perceived and implemented Furthermore the influence of the NordicBaltic cooperation in adult education may also be traced in adult education policy implications in Lithuania Some changes in the policies of contemporary Lithuania have not been successful and even failed to promote a democratic societyThe Baltic countries regained their independence from the Soviet Union in the early s and joined the European Union inThis article seeks to explore institutional development and reforms of adult education and lifelong learning in Lithuania with respect to the processes the actors and the context of socioeconomic change over the pastyears It also looks at the implications of these processes for the professionalisation of adult educators referred to here as adult learning teachers ALTs The authors begin with an analysis of the historicalinstitutional and politicaleconomical aspects of the development of adult education and lifelong learning by providing a retrospective of institutional change in Lithuania They then move on to analyse the existing institutional and legal arrangements of adult education which shape and institutionalise the profession and qualifications of ALTs Their empirical research reveals the opinions of Lithuanian ALTs on their current professional occupational profile and its future developmentAs an urban middle school begins to implement the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program this study explores the process of experiencing a curricular change from the perspective of the teachers and students themselves Through the use of a mixed methods approach key administrators teachers and students were interviewed in the first year of implementation During the second year teachers were surveyed as a means of tracking the change over time that teachers may have been experiencing Themes emerged in the areas of instructional practice professional experiences and student experiences Most interestingly and not expected was a theme related to whether IB was a good fit for the students in this particular school Participants ability to highlight the successes and challenges inherent in a change process is discussed in light of future planningWe compared the prevalence of various medical and behavioral cooccurring conditionssymptoms betweenand yearolds with autism spectrum disorder ASD from five sites in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network during thesurvey year accounting for sociodemographic differences Overof children had at least one cooccurring conditionsymptom Overall the prevalence was higher inthan yearolds forof cooccurring conditionssymptoms examined Further our data suggested that cooccurring conditionssymptoms increased or decreased the age at which children were first evaluated for ASD Similarly among the yearolds the prevalence of most cooccurring conditionssymptoms was higher in children with a previous ASD diagnosis documented in their records These findings are informative for understanding and screening cooccurring conditionssymptoms in ASDAbstract Teen mothers face unique barriers to continuing education making important the identification of key elements in their support systems that facilitate educational attainment In this longitudinal quasiexperimental study we investigate the unique role of different types and sources of support measured at baseline from family and father of the baby on teen mothers return to school after childbirth We analyze data ofurban lowincome African American teen mothers retained overmonths Results show that teen mothers who received parental financial support soon after giving birth were overtimes as likely to be in school or have graduated when their children were a year old Additionally remaining in a romantic relationship with the father of the baby was associated with reduced odds of returning to school but only in the absence of an intervention program designed to support teen parent familiesFindings highlight the unique importance of parental financial support shortly after birth on teen mothers school retention and suggest the relevance of clinical staff in supporting teen mothers in couple relationships to continue their educationCollective teacher efficacy CTE beliefs serve to encourage certain behaviours and constrain others Bandura Educ Psycholxrefxref was the first to generate interest in this area by demonstrating that the effect of perceived CTE on student achievement was stronger than the link between socioeconomic status and student achievement The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the productive patterns of behaviour and other consequences resulting from educators shared sense of efficacy Studies showed that CTE was associated with a number of productive behaviours including implementation of school improvement strategies increased teacher leadership communication of high expectations and a strong focus on academic pursuits In addition CTE was associated with other positive factors including greater job satisfaction commitment to students and the teaching profession and positive attitudes toward teaching students with special education needs and professional development Collective efficacy was negatively related to performance goal orientations and positively related to students emotional engagement Finally there were a number of studies that established the relationship between CTE and individual teacher efficacy It is important to acknowledge that the relationship between CTE and other variables included in the studies contained within this review are most likely bidirectional Policy makers system and school leaders and staff developers efforts toward successful education reforms might be better served by strategically and intentionally considering how to foster collective efficacy throughout the conceptualization design delivery and assessment of change initiatives Suggestions for future research and limitations including potential measurement problems of included studies are sharedThis study reports on a largescale survey on primary school teachers perceptions of being change agents and the extent to which these perceptions are related to personality and contextual factors A principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis revealed nine characteristics of teachers as change agents Personality and contextual factors are related to teachers perceptions of being a change agent Four teacher profiles were distinguished according to the varying degrees of teachers perceptions of themselves as change agents This study adds to the further understanding of teachers as change agents their characteristics and how these characteristics are related to personality and contextual factorsReforms in education often fail due to insufficient time to implement them too few charismatic leaders the influence of the preceding culture scarce resources or an incapacity to comprehend the complexity of the education system Most studies dealing with the cognitive aspects of educational change investigate the meaning of change through the lens of the educators and principals and there is not as much research available on the perception and interpretation of change by policy makers and the language they use to communicate messages about policy that affect sensemakingsensegiving during the process of learning about the changes Guided by the premise that the language of a reform movement is shaped by its ideology this article illustrates how press releases of the Ministry of Education in Canton Sarajevo in BosniaHerzegovina reflect an exploitationoriented dominant reform logic The results of frequency analysis hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling imply that MoE is driven by a topdown perspective to educational change with a focus on the procedural organizational and collaborational aspects of reforms that primarily alter the structure of the education system but not its internal substance We end this paper by suggesting that educational system as complex adaptive system cannot be controlled but effectively managed through distribution of control and creation of few attractors benefiting from selforganization in the technical core and making change in the official topdown rhetoricThe aim of this systematic review of qualitative studies is to explore the opinions and experiences of primary care providers regarding violence against women Structured searches were conducted in nine bibliographic databases MarchStudy identification critical appraisal using the CASP tool and analyses thematic synthesis were conductedqualitative studies were selected Three main themes were identifiedDefining violence against women and its causesAwareness of violence against women and disclosure with subthemesBarriers experienced by primary care providersFacilitators for providing appropriate helpActions taken by providers to help women Violence against women was generally considered as an unacceptable act with important health consequences Barriers to address violence against women included organizational factors providers subjective feelings and perceived role and providers perceptions about women facing violence against women Facilitators included a trusting relationship with women attentive nonjudgmental listening participate in the community teamwork and continuing education Providing emotional support and offering information about resources were the main actions taken by primary care providers Womencentred care respecting womens decision making processes and a biopsychosocial approach may provide direction to more compassionate and supportive care while strengthening primary healthcare responseThe doctoral dissertation is a key component of postgraduate education that plays an important role for knowledge production and hence the development of a discipline Swedish human geography currently lacks an overview of dissertations This article fills this knowledge gap by reporting findings from a unique database covering all doctoral dissertations betweenandThe paper focuses on the demographics of the authors age gender the format of the dissertation and explores productivity variations for authors of compilation dissertations The findings show a notable increase in the number of doctoral dissertations since the late s but a decreasing share of doctoral dissertations in the social sciences since the s In terms of demographics we show that while the age of the authors remains relatively stable the genderbalance has improved considerably In terms of format the monograph has rapidly given way to compilation dissertations which now account for half the number of dissertations More thanof all dissertations are now published in English Statistical results suggest that the likelihood of completing a compilation dissertation is greater if the doctoral candidate is young and if attending Ume University But individual author productivity for compilation dissertations is mainly influenced by unobservablesThis paper reports student perceptions of the benefits and challenges of Bring Your Own Device BYOD in a fieldwork context Student perceptions from six field courses across two institutions have been gathered using questionnaires and focus groups Whilst a number of studies have focused on BYOD in a classroom context little research has been undertaken about BYOD in a fieldwork context The key findings suggest that around one fifth of students were not willing to use their own device during fieldwork citing loss or damage as the main reason This key challenge is different to that which are found in a classroom which generally focus on network security connectivity etc The findings also suggest that some students believe that BYOD can have a negative impact on group work There is a misalignment here between student and practitioner thinking with previous literature which suggests that practitioners believe BYOD and smart devices can enhance group work The one key challenge which is found regardless of learning environment is inequality between those who have a device and those who do notThis paper explores issues perceptions and experiences related to the transition from studying geography at school to university The findings seek to highlight that there are a range of stakeholders that can be engaged in this transition process as well as a range of strategies for doing so The transition from school to university geography has a number of implications for both students and educators and this paper seeks to discuss reinvigorate discussions around transitions in the geographical communityAcademic integrity issues eg plagiarism continue to plague higher education across the globe Research has noted that the identification and tolerance of cheating behaviors varies dependent upon local culture This quantitative comparative study investigated the potential differences among actual rates of incidence of plagiarism among predominant countries and regions in which the literature identified as having academic integrity problems This study gathered doctoral dissertations and masters theses from institutions in the selected locations and analyzed them with Turnitin originality assessment software Regions and countries evaluated were based on guidance from exigent literature A KruskalWallis test was conducted to evaluate any differences in the prevalence of plagiarism among these locations The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference among groups N pFurther analysis determined a mix of findings that both support and deny conceptions in other literatureWith the majority of undergraduate teaching in Australian higher education being undertaken by casual academics ensuring adequate support for these staff to access support and professional development relating to teaching and learning is imperative In this article we profile the development and implementation of a universitywide strategic framework for training support and recognition of the contributions of sessional teachers The design of this framework was informed through an iterative process of research and consultation with key institutional stakeholders and has resulted in changes at a policy level as well as in the delivery of professional development programs for sessional teaching staff The opportunities and challenges of this approach are discussed as well as future directions and broader considerations for the support of sessional teachers in the Australian higher education contextEducative curricula curriculum materials that intentionally foster teacher professional development can serve as a site for teacher learning through their use in daily instructional practices The present article introduces a framework Teacher Learning Opportunities in Mathematics Curriculum Materials TLOMath for designing and evaluating mathematics curriculum materials educative features according to seven theoretically based variablesmathematics content knowledge for teachingteacher knowledge of student thinking in mathematicsteacher knowledge of disciplinary discourse in mathematicsteacher knowledge of assessment in mathematicsteacher knowledge of differentiated instruction in mathematicsteacher knowledge of technology use in mathematics andteacher knowledge of mathematical community Each variable is illustrated with a definition guiding questions disciplinespecific literature and examples from two sets of elementary mathematics curriculum materials The development of the TLOMath framework is a critical first step for further study of the use of mathematics curriculum materials as sites for teacher learningRecent studies have established connections among teachers mental health and student outcomes however there is limited understanding of how these teacher characteristics manifest in the classroom to affect students The present study informed this gap by examining the associations among third grade teachersNselfreported symptoms of clinical depression and their studentsNclassroom instructional experiences Eight student experiences described by the Individualizing Student Instruction framework were investigated including academic instruction facilitated by the teacher in various student groupings students independent and group work teachers planningorganizing instruction and students time offtask and in transitions Multilevel modeling revealed negative associations between teachers depressive symptoms and a teacherfacilitated academic instruction provided to the whole class and b teachers planningorganizing instruction Results suggest that teachers experiencing more symptoms may underutilize instructional approaches that require more effort on their part We discussed the implications of our findings for students academic and socialemotional learning and the potential benefits of incorporating mental health support components into teacher training and professional development aimed at improving instructional practicesThe purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches which included concept mapping collaborative game playing and group lesson planning The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop To begin and end the teacher workshop teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers Researchers audiorecorded individual teachers argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers argumentation Toulmins argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants argumentative statements While the analysis of differences in pre and postworkshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly the quality of participants argumentation did increase significantly As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers argumentation Additionally these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants knowledge facilitate the presentation of argumentation and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers argumentation skillsThis article uses an existing evaluation framework to exemplify how an organic chemistry program for high school teachers facilitated their professional development Chemistry teachers fromdifferent high schools participated in the program The professional development program was informed by a constructivist theoretical background in which teachers situated learning and sociocultural factors were central to supporting meaningful learning To facilitate teachers professional development the researcher worked recurrently withhigh school chemistry teachers overyears This article identifies the key elements of the professional development program that influenced change in the teachers practices Analysis of qualitative data collected showed that the hybridisation of the professional learning and teaching space the nonhierarchical role of the program facilitator and a focus on student learning were characteristic factors that contributed to the change in teachers practices The salient implications for teacher professional development and teacher learning are discussedPeoples knowledge about nature their interest in nature their nature experiences and their values and emotions regarding nature are factors that promote peoples positive views on environmental issues and sustainability Knowing the variation and patterns in teachers and student teachers views is an essential step in considering the ways in which sustainability might be interpreted and enacted in schools and in teacher education The aim of this study is to analyze student teachers views on the importance of species and species identification in general and as a part of their professional development regarding their understanding of biodiversity and sustainability A total ofstudent teachers in Finland Norway and Sweden answered a questionnaire consisting of fixed and openended questions Mixed methods were used t test and analysis of variance for quantitative data and inductive and deductive modelbased content analysis for qualitative data According to the majority of student teachersboth species identification and biodiversity are important for sustainability species identification in general was important toof them Their statements about importance contained mostly ecological viewsfollowed by emotionaleducationaland utilitarianviews The remainder of the student teachers statementscontained negativistic or indifferent views The reasons for the low percentage of educational views are discussed The implications of the results for teacher education worldwide are emphasized especially the importance of those teaching methods that have the potential to increase student teachers understanding of sustainabilitySupporting elementary preservice teachers development of a science teacher identity provides a way to address challenges of low selfefficacy selfconfidence and pedagogical content knowledge in science Meaningful teaching experiences in student teaching placements and fieldbased science methods courses provide opportunities for preservice teachers to develop their identities as science teachers and deepen their understandings of social justice issues in science This collective case study examined how the teacher and science teacher identities of three elementary preservice teachers and their becoming social justice teachers developed during their first semester of student teaching after taking a onesemester science methods course The study drew on subject matter teacher identity positioning theory and social justice science teacher identity Preservice teachers personal identities and histories university coursework positioning in their student teaching classrooms and opportunities to authentically teach were identified as mediating influences on the development of their teacher and science teacher identity as well as their perceived ability to teach science for social justice The study has implications for understanding the ways in which student teaching experiences including how cooperating teachers position student teachers support or work against reformoriented science teacher identities developed through university courseworkGains have been made over the last two decades in how to identify evidencebased practices for students with disabilities but less progress has been made in ensuring that these interventions are used by classroom teachers Although it is not the only area that needs to be addressed to bridge this researchtopractice gap providing highquality information about effective interventions in a format that is easy for teachers to understand is an important piece of a much larger implementation science puzzle The current study analyzed a wide range of prominent special education practitioner journals to develop a comprehensive picture of the extent to which research is translated to practice for teachers who work with students with mild disabilities learning disabilities emotionalbehavioral disorders autismLevelALI Results from the analysis ofarticles showed that across journals fewer thanof articles translated intervention research findings to practice with over half targeting academicsBackground Women surgeons continue to face unique challenges to professional advancement Higher attrition rates and lower confidence among female surgical residents suggest that experiences during residency differ by gender Few studies have investigated genderspecific experiences during training This study identifies genderbased differences in the experiences of general surgery residents that could affect professional development Materials and methods Male and female general surgery residents at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center participated in a semistructured interview study exploring the significance of gender in training Recurring themes were identified from transcribed interviews using inductive methods Two individuals independently coded interviews Themes were compared for male and female residents Certain themes arose with greater frequency in reference to one gender over the other Results Twentyfour male and eighteen female residents participatedin the study Fewer female residents selfidentified as a surgeonversusP Residents felt that patients and physicians more frequently disregarded female residents professional roleP Female residents also more often mentioned perceiving aggressive behaviors from attendings and support staffversusandversusrespectively Relative to men women more often mentioned lack of mentorshipversusdiscomfortversusfeeling pressured to participate in unprofessional behaviorsversusand having difficulty completing tasksversusP Conclusions Women experience genderbased challenges during surgical training Further investigation is needed to determine how these experiences affect professional developmentWho wants to become a business leader We investigated whether young adults work values ie the importance placed on different job characteristics and rewards predict their entrepreneurial aspirations ie the intention to create a venture and leadership aspirations ie the intention to become a leader in a business context Furthermore we illuminated whether gender differences in work values contribute to the pervasive gender gap in these aspirations Analyses in a sample of young adults from FinlandNrevealed that a higher importance placed on extrinsic rewards and a lower importance placed on security at agepredicted higher entrepreneurial and leadership aspirations at ageover and above personality motivational and sociodemographic factors Additionally a higher importance placed on socialinterpersonal rewards predicted lower entrepreneurial but higher leadership aspirations and a higher importance placed on autonomy predicted higher entrepreneurial aspirations Gender differences in work values explained a substantial share of the gender gap in entrepreneurial and leadership aspirations Here mens higher endorsement of extrinsic rewards and lower endorsement of security proved most critical These findings suggest that work values are implicated in shaping young peoples aspirations to business leadership and contribute strongly to the gender gap thereinUnderstanding how individuals make sense of their professions provides important guidance for career decisions and career counseling In this paper we aim to further our knowledge of professionspecific selfunderstandings by investigating collective accounts of what professional members consider to be one of us In contrast to objective approaches to job descriptions our study thus investigates the subjective framings of professional identities For this purpose we collected selfdescriptions from two different professions police officersnand market researchersnContent analysis of theresulting statements revealed that selfdescriptions in both professions relied on only a small number of thematic building blocks for their construction yet focused on disparate aspects to frame their identities We refer to these framings as identity configurationsreflecting variations in the relevance given to topics and themes across professional groups Comparing these collective accounts of identity configurations with existing schemes we find important additions to current understandings of professional identities by their members Our findings also reveal the multilevel nature of professional selfdescriptions Our observations offer a new conceptual lens to study professional selfunderstandings with practical applications for career counseling and guidance In addition our paper contributes to discussions around identity congruence as well as the content and multilevel nature of professional identitiesThe purpose of this qualitative study is to contribute to the scholarship on career success within a boundaryless career context Within the body of boundaryless careers research we adopt the intelligent career framework to highlight success factors described by twentyeight distinguished academics DAs and eight of their spouses to illustrate the DAs approach to extreme success in academia Our results further support the existence of six unidirectional links as well as further links between the frameworks three ways of knowing that have not been thoroughly examined in the career success literature Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for career scholars and practitionersStudents with learning disabilities LD often receive instruction in general education science classrooms However little is known about the academic success of students with LD in this setting As inquirybased science instruction has become more prominent research focusing on student learning is needed to explore how such instruction meets students needs To address this a crosscase analysis was conducted It included six middle school students each with LD from a Midwestern city Each student was enrolled in a general education science class that used inquirybased instruction Data sources included student and educator interviews classroom observations and student portfolios Results indicated that most of the students with LD had difficulty acquiring science process knowledge and that students relied on peer supports to facilitate their learning Findings extend the research on science instruction for students with LD in middle school classrooms using inquirybased instructionAccumulating research has established explicit mathematics instruction as an evidencebased teaching practice This study utilized observation data from a multiyear efficacy trial to examine the longitudinal effects of a core kindergarten mathematics program on the use of explicit mathematics instruction among two distinct groups of teachers one group that used standard practices in Yearof the efficacy trial and the core program in Yearand a second group that used the core program in both years Targeted teaching practices consisted of teacher models student practice opportunities and teacherprovided academic feedback Implementation of the program in Yearwas found to increase the mean rates of teaching practices of teachers who used standard teaching practices in YearEffect sizes are also suggestive of a positive impact of a second year of implementation with the core program Implications for designing explicit mathematics programs and investigating evidencebased practices in future research are discussedThe number of students with learning disabilities LD enrolling in postsecondary education has increased rapidly over the past decade It is imperative to investigate what interventions have been used to assist students with LD in achieving academic success To examine the interventions currently used to support students with LD in postsecondary education the authors reviewed the relevant literature fromtoFour primary types of interventions were identified fromarticles assistive technology direct assistance strategy instruction and comprehensive support program The findings indicate that the studentcentered approach is an important characteristic of current academic interventions for students with LD in postsecondary education The authors also provide implications for researchers and practitioners for improving postsecondary interventions on students with LDObjectives Training healthcare professionals in emergency maternal healthcare is a critical component of improving overall maternal health in developing countries like Rwanda This paper explored the challenges that healthcare professionals who participated in a Continuing Professional Development CPD program on Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics ALSO face in putting the learned knowledge and skills into practice in hospitals of Rwanda Methods This study used a mixed methods approach to understand the challengesbarriers to applying new knowledge and skills in the hospitals of Rwanda We conducted thirteen purposive indepth interviews with ALSO trainees nurses midwives and physicians complemented with a crosssectional survey on staff turnover in eight of the nine hospitals in the Eastern province of Rwanda Results Our study found that trainees do not get enough opportunity to apply the new knowledge and skills in their hospitals and expand to health centers In part because they are frequently rotating to different departments of the hospital and are not getting the opportunity to train their colleagues to share the learned knowledge and skills The lack of refresher trainingsmentorship and the high personnel turnover were also reported as a barrier to applying new knowledge and skills Reasons for staff turnover included pursuing further studies a better opportunity jobremuneration low morale and family related motives including joining a spouse or better schools for children Conclusions for Practice Expanding and formalizing CPD training to all the healthcare professionals involved in providing maternal care services would improve the provision of emergency maternal healthcare in RwandaIn the article the author discusses the importance of rural medical education research in the professional identity development of medical educators physicians and other health care professionals Also cited are the need for medical schools to produce professionals who will serve the communities around their educational institutions and the key effect of a doseresponse relationship in the decision of learners to practise in a rural regionBackground Continuing Professional Development is important for maintaining and developing knowledge and skills Evidence regarding direct impact on practice is limited Existing literature often lacks sufficient detail regarding the initiative or its evaluation making transferability problematic Objective To explore the impact and perceived value of multidisciplinary Continuing Professional Development workshops for Health Visitors who support families with children with complex health needs Design Realistic Evaluation principles guided the research Workshop attendees were invited to participate nn agreed Data collection included a questionnaire and semistructured interviews Data analysis included descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis Setting One North of England Health Service Trust Findings Interrelated temporal themes emerged Before the workshop expectations included uncertainty regarding content and ambiguity regarding attendance During workshops comments focused on networking opportunities the detail content and facilitation of the learning experience Emotional safety enabled interaction sharing and absorption of information and potentially increased trust confidence and social capital Participants viewed the workshop as informative enhancing insight regarding roles services and processes Postworkshop participants reported examples of practice enhancements attributed to workshop attendance including confidence building improved team working facilitation of early referral and accessing additional support for families Conclusions Findings suggest initiative developers aiming CPD at new or existing teams need to consider nurturing social capital and to pay attention to the context and mechanisms which can prompt attendance engagement and subsequent practice applicationboldObjective boldTo identify and examine tensions and uncertainties in personcentred approaches to selfmanagement supportapproaches that take patients seriously as moral agents and orient support to enable them to live and die well on their own termsboldMethods boldInterviews withUK clinicians about working with people with diabetes or Parkinsons disease conducted within a broader interdisciplinary project on selfmanagement support The analysis reported here was informed by philosophical reasoning and discussions with stakeholdersboldResults boldPersoncentred approaches require clinicians to balance tensions between the many things that can matter in life and their own and each patients perspectives on these Clinicians must ensure that their supportive efforts do not inadvertently disempower people When attending to someones particular circumstances and perspectives they sometimes face intractable uncertainties including about what is most important to the person and what realistically the person can or could do and achieve The kinds of professional judgement that personcentred working necessitates are not always acknowledged and supportedboldConclusion boldPractical and ethical tensions are inherent in personcentred support and need to be better understood and addressedboldPractice Implications boldProfessional development and service improvement initiatives should recognise these tensions and uncertainties and support clinicians to navigate them wellLesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT youth experience disproportionate rates of bullying compared to their heterosexual peers Schools are wellpositioned to address these disparities by creating supportive school climates for LGBT youth but more research is needed to examine the variety of practices and professional development opportunities put in place to this end The current study examines how school practices to create supportive LGBT student climate relate to student reports of bullying Studentlevel data come from theMinnesota Student Survey a statewide survey of risk and protective factors Ninth and eleventh grade students N reported on frequency of physical and relational bullying victimization and perpetration and sexual orientationbased harassment School administrators reported on six practices related to creating supportive LGBT school climate N schools having a point person for LGBT student issues displaying sexual orientationspecific content having a gaystraight alliance discussing bullying based on sexual orientation and providing professional development around LGBT inclusion and LGBT student issues An index was created to indicate how many practices each school used M SD Multilevel logistic regressions indicated that students attending schools with more supportive LGBT climates reported lower odds of relational bullying victimization physical bullying perpetration and sexual orientationbased harassment compared to students in schools with less supportive LGBT climates Sexual orientation did not moderate these relations indicating that LGBTsupportive practices may be protective for all students regardless of their sexual orientation Findings support schoolwide efforts to create supportive climates for LGBQ youth as part of a larger bullying prevention strategyPurpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a mandatory transition to New Ways of Working NWW on employees job demands ie mental demands workload and task ambiguity job resources ie autonomy supervisor support coworker support and possibilities for development and their levels of burnout and work engagement Additionally it was investigated whether the effects of the transition depended on employees personal resources Psychological CapitalPsyCap Designmethodologyapproach We investigated an organization in transition In three waves one before and two after the transition data were collected via online surveys amongemployees of a large Dutch provider of financial services Findings NWW were beneficial in reducing mental demands and workload and did not harm the relationships with supervisor and coworkers However autonomy and possibilities for professional development decreased Burnout and work engagement remained stable over time The effects of the transition did not depend on employees PsyCap Implications NWW have received a very positive popular press Scientific evidence for its beneficial andor adverse effects on worker wellbeing can help organizations making an informed decision when considering NWW Moreover this can help to develop targeted interventions that alleviate the negative consequences eg paying extra attention to professional development Originalityvalue This is one of the first longitudinal studies in which employees were followed who transitioned to NWW Building on the Job DemandsResources model this study provides a comprehensive picture of the effects of NWWTeacher coaching has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional models of professional development We review the empirical literature on teacher coaching and conduct metaanalyses to estimate the mean effect of coaching programs on teachers instructional practice and students academic achievement Combining results acrossstudies that employ causal research designs we find pooled effect sizes ofstandard deviations SD on instruction andSD on achievement Much of this evidence comes from literacy coaching programs for prekindergarten and elementary school teachers in the United States Although these findings affirm the potential of coaching as a development tool further analyses illustrate the challenges of taking coaching programs to scale while maintaining effectiveness Average effects from effectiveness trials of larger programs are only a fraction of the effects found in efficacy trials of smaller programs We conclude by discussing ways to address scaleup implementation challenges and providing guidance for future causal studiesIn Canada like many countries the national standard and provincial regulations require that workers performing maintenance repair and unjamming activities on machinery must follow lockout procedures However the high number of accidents linked to hazardous energies and machinery shows that organizations have difficulty with the application of lockout arrangements or use of alternative methods Therefore it is important to understand how organizations implement lockout programs and procedures and the extent to which they are in accordance with relevant standards and regulations In this qualitative research the application of lockout and alternative methods was studied inorganizations in Quebec through a group interview document review and site observation in each organization In each organiztion the researchers conducted a group interview and completed a questionnaire which included more than a hundred questions on the lockout program application of lockout procedures alternative methods subcontractor management training and auditinspection The researchers then used observation data and documentation collected from each organization to verify interviewee responses and to finalize the questionnaire The shortcomings found included i incomplete lockout programs ii missing steps in general lockout procedures iii not reading the placards iv using alternative methods without risk assessment v poor training for alternative methods vi absence of supervision and coordination of subcontractors vii and lack of audit tools and documentation of audit results Despite the shortcomings actual lockout practices in the organizations visited were better than what was described in their lockout programs Recommendations for addressing identified shortcomings are proposedThe article focuses on Next Generation Science Standards NGSS were introduced and many science teachers skimmed the list of science and engineering practices looking for descriptions that matched their existing inquirybased ways of teaching It mentions actions of scientists to make sense of and engage in the practices and lessons that support the science and engineering practices It also mentions lesson on plant adaptations and seed dispersalI investigatedmigrant workers bicultural identity integration social support and social maladjustment to shed light on the cultural conflict they experience and determine whether this differs between men and women Results revealed that men had significantly higher levels of social support than women did and women had significantly higher levels of social maladjustment than men did however there were no significant gender differences in bicultural identity integration Furthermore cultural conflict and social maladjustment were negatively predicted by social support whereas cultural conflict mediated the effect of social support on social maladjustment My findings suggest that positive social support for migrant workers could enhance their bicultural identity integration promote more effective social adaptation and help eliminate gender differences in social maladjustmentSocial work combines professional knowledge and practice skills Current developments in UK social work education appear to prioritise workplace skills acquisition over traditional academic teaching methods and this refocus may lead to a decline in UK university social work programmes In this paper we propose social work education can learn from nurse and health programmes to develop innovative simulationbased education Modern technologies allow for interactive and immersive learning experiences which enable students to develop practice skills safely Through interactive and immersive simulations facilitated by modern technology we suggest social work education can bridge the gap between knowledge and skillsThis article presents a qualitative artsinformed inquiry on teaching and learning in social work education Using artsinformed research methodology and grounded theory methodology the research analyses ten interviews of social work educators in two Canadian provinces This article focused on how university educators use artsinformed methods of teaching about social justice through antiracist and decolonizing lenses also discussed are the educators personal and professional transformation and development within this process The main findings discuss the importance of creating an artful space as a platform for experiential embodied and emotive learning which offers an innovative more holistic and comprehensive way of teaching social justice This way of teaching emphasizes personal transformation giving space to marginalized voices and expression as well as collective cocreation of meaning and creating practical tools for future social change The study also touches upon challenges and gaps in using an artsinformed approach which include student resistance to alternative ways of education expressed specifically by racialized educators and ambiguity related to assessing artful works in an academic setting The paper ends with recommendations for social work educationIn recent years many changes have taken place in the Spanish University system and as a consequence the university lecturers role has evolved and a new teaching style prevails The present paper focuses on University teachers of Economics and Business studies It explores the teachers perception about the new methodologies that they have implemented the extent to which the process of change has modified their way of working and finally the benefits and drawbacks encountered Moreover we examine whether differences of opinion arise depending on the distinct personal and professional characteristics of each teacher The results reveal that most of the methodological changes undergone by the teachers stem more from the new profile of their students than by regulatory obligations There is a unanimous opinion that the time and effort dedicated to teaching is now notably greater and that it is necessary to develop a rigorous system of teaching evaluationThis paper explains how engineering students at a Danish university acquired the necessary skills to become emergent facilitators of organisational development The implications of this approach are discussed and related to relevant viewpoints and findings in the literature The methodology deployed for this paper is empirical and conceptual A specific facilitation project carried out by six international engineering students is presented The importance of combining cognitive emotional and synergistic skills is highlighted on the basis of this example the authors extensive experience in teaching facilitation and the literature These types of skills are most effectively acquired by combining conceptual lectures classroom exercises and the facilitation of groups in a reallife context The paper also reflects certain shadow sides related to facilitation observed by the students and discussed in the literature The educational process description and reflections presented in this paper can help university staff and mentors in public and private organisations to adopt interactive methods for education and training A brief overview of the methods used is included in the Appendix By connecting the literature the authors and engineering students reflections on facilitator skills this paper adds value to existing academic and practical discussions on learning facilitating leadershipSpecial educators assume an essential leadership role in schoolwide multilayered instructional systems for teaching culturally and linguistically diverse learners with and without disabilities including learners at risk of being inappropriately referred for special education Research findings from a model demonstration project are presented informing research to practice in the a development of partnerships b delivery of effective professional development and c framing of cultural and linguistic responsive teaching to improve instruction for English learners ELs in Grades K in elementary schools in a rural community Content skill sets and tools to include in educator training for general and special educators who teach English language and other diverse learners are recommended based on project findingsThis mixed methods descriptive study examined the effects of jobembedded professional development JEPD in reading on the content knowledge and instructional practice of teachers of English learners ELs Four firstgrade teachers of ELs at one urban elementary school received JEPD over the course of a year Results of pre and posttests of teacher knowledge and classroom observations indicated that teachers reading content knowledge increased and that they used more evidencebased practices JEPD shows promise as an approach that accommodates teachers varying levels of knowledge and experience in preparing them to meet the diverse needs of their studentsEducator preparation in comprehension strategy instruction CSI is essential to meeting the needs of English learners ELs in contemporary schools This article provides teacher educators and professional developers with concrete examples of practices to prepare classroom teachers in comprehensive strategy instruction based on an experimental study that examined the effectof CSI on thirdgrade students n wordproblemsolving WPS performance CSI included problemsolving strategies that a helped students to understand the relevant and irrelevant information in a word problems question b helped students to restate the problem orally which allowed them to understand to construct meaning and to clarify any misunderstanding about the question and c provided instructional feedback with student collaboration for problem solving and solution Findings indicate that a focus on CSI may help facilitate WPS skills developing for ELs at risk of mathematicslearning difficulties MLD Educator preparation recommendations are embedded throughout with implications for future research and practice also discussedThis paper studies the social side of preservice teacher education and draws on social network analysis to explore the relation between the social capital of preservice teachers and their academic and professional success An online survey was applied to a sample ofstudents enrolled full time either in Preschool Education or Primary Education programmes at the Ramon Llull UniversityFPCEE Blanquerna in Catalonia Spain The instrument consisted of a combination of social network questions and rating scale attributes Findings allow us to understand the relationship between aspects of the cohorts social network and key development constructs and demonstrate the importance of considering informal interactions within the programme to improve the performance of preservice teachersThis study takes a narrative perspective to examine teachers as writers and autobiographical creative writing as a way for promoting teachers professional development In a creative writing group for Finnish primary and secondary school teachers the teachers expressed themselves and explored their lives and identities through autobiographical creative writing The aim of this study was to examine the stories the teachers tell about their relationship to writing and the goals they set for their professional and personal development in the writing group Through thematic analysis seven descriptive themes were found in teachers narratives of writing Furthermore based on the narrative analysis a poemlike word image was composed This study illustrates how literary methods diversify teachers narratives The findings shed light on teachers as creative writers and emphasise the connection between writing and wellbeing Creative writing groups can be beneficial for teachers professional development identity work and wellbeingMost studies of schoolbased mentoring practice have put their key focus on discussions of the professional growth of novice teachers rather than of their mentors Mentoring practice however is also a platform from which mentors can build or enhance their professional competency and capitalize their leadership role as they interact with novice teachers and their colleagues This is an area which deserves further research attention Drawing on the concept of social capital this smallscale qualitative study investigates how mentors can develop or revise their mentoring skills and knowledge while they engage in schoolbased mentoring practice Semistructured interviews and documents were collected frommentors from primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong fromtoFindings of this study firstly show that both bonding social capital and bridging social capital can help mentors develop their mentoring knowledge in different ways Secondly bridging social capital can help mentors act as boundary brokers who develop transformative learning by interacting with outside experts Providing more offsite or clusterbased mentor training programs and mentoring partnership schemes with outside experts could be the way forward to maximize the professional competency of mentors aiming at improving school capacityThe purpose of this study was to notice and name the beliefspreservice teachers had about literacy teachinglearning The beliefs were noted by using evidence from their languageinuse during supported literacy planning sessions with a teacher educator Critical discourse analysis revealed that the preservice teachers believedassessment is instruction literacy teachinglearning is inauthentic andchildren are not intellectually motivatedThe findings are discussed through the lenses of figured worlds and the apprenticeship of observation Implications for teacher educators are offeredThe present study investigates how teachers motivation relates to burnout and engagement teaching style and need satisfaction at work A total ofsecondary teachers completed validated questionnaires Four profiles were retained in the cluster analysis Results showed that teachers who were high on autonomous motivation displayed the most optimal pattern of outcomes whereas teachers who were high on amotivation showed the opposite pattern Teachers who were high on controlled motivation were engaged in their jobs yet they had a greater risk of burnout and of establishing an ego climate Implications for educational policy and practice are discussedExamining the voices of English teachers regarding the extent to which Australian high schools are providing inclusive environments this paper aims to generate deeper understandings about countering cisnormativity and heteronormativity Drawing on a qualitative study conducted in Western Australia the theoretical framework meshes the lenses of Bakhtinand Foucaultto create an emergent model integrating concepts such as the panoptic surveillance dialogic utterances and heteroglossic language Results reveal how teacher discourses concerning the provision of LGBTQI curriculum and resources link to networks of power and are imbued with a multiplicity of patterns tensions and contradictionsAlthough video clubs have been used to support student teachers learning through reflection upon practice less attention has been paid to their potential use for supporting changes in participants practice over a period of time Prior work has also largely treated student teachers as an undifferentiated whole that benefits in similar ways from video clubs In this study we problematize this assumption by drawing on three cases of student teachers to exemplify three different learning paths while participating in a video club during field placement Reflecting on these findings we discuss implications for differentiating the videoclub approach to address different student teachersThis paper aims to contribute to the theorisation of effective teacher development TD provision in a reform context Based on a literature review the paper identifies key reform features ie ambiguity and conflict generation that shape teachers engagement with pedagogic reforms and suggests a framework for designing TD programmes that address reformspecific needs It then explores the utility of this heuristic framework through an indepth case study of implementation of and perceptions about eight reforms in two schools in Hong Kong The case study confirmed that customising the TD provision to perceived reform characteristics could contribute to teachers positive perceptions of and experience with reformsThe interview study explores in what kind of settings people broker at the boundary of educational research and school practice and what kind of learning they experience Learning mechanisms identification coordination reflection transformation were related to three settings research projects in schools network activities professional development Responses byindividuals indicate that all three settings allowed for learning via identification reflection and coordination Still respondents that solely broker in the setting of professional development were less likely to learn via all three mechanisms Transformation was only realized in settings that enabled people to establish forms of joint project workWe used the process model of emotion regulation to gain a deeper understanding of teachers emotion regulation goals and strategies Fiftysix teachers reported why and how they regulate emotions while in the classroom Findings indicated that teachers have instrumental and hedonic emotion regulation goals are focused on regulating both their own and their students emotions and are typically attempting to decrease negative emotions Findings showed that teachers use a variety of strategies to regulate emotions however the response modulation strategy of suppression was the most frequently reported strategy Implications for teachers teacher education programs and future research are discussedAlthough often assessed as one construct teachers have been shown to draw on both content and pedagogical content knowledge as they teach reading Factor analysis on sixtysix primary teachers in rural lowwealth districts illustrated that teacher knowledge of reading can be distinguished separately as content and pedagogical content knowledge with teachers having roughly equal levels of knowledge across domains Multiple regression analyses demonstrated teaching experience was the only teacher characteristic to be significantly associated with both domains of teacher knowledge implicating the necessity of increasing experiential learning components in teacher educationTo determine if and how teachers are being educated about effective learning strategies we analysed the topical coverage of two highly effective strategies distributed practice and retrieval practice in introductory teacher education textbooks and syllabi We examinedtextbooks used in Flemish and Dutch teacher education programmes TEPs by inventorying descriptive and prescriptive information on these strategies therein Also we analysed whether the coverage referred to actual research The results indicated that mostly textbooks fail to fully represent the strategies Accurate textbooks are used in a minority of TEPs Implications and challenges for authors TEPs and policymakers are discussedMany recent studies have stressed the importance of teacher candidates TCs selfregulated learning SRL skills for successful learning Because of the promising consequences of SRL for academic performance teacher educators TEs are encouraged to increase TCs SRL opportunities in educational programs Because of the difficulty and complexity for TEs to successfully guide TCs towards SRL the present study contributes to the discussion how to best facilitate TEs in finding a balance between student and teachercontrol For this purpose a conceptual model is presented The model draws upon literature related to the perspective of the learner the teacher and the learning task Besides the context of teacher education the model is beneficial for higher education as well as teaching and teacher professionalization It will help instructors provide a more balanced approach between teacher and studentcontrolled learning and support students develop essential SRL skillsCritical reflexivity has been acknowledged as fundamental in higher education For facing complex situations in turbulent environments students nowadays need not only to be taught technical knowledge but also to be helped develop relevant learning for their future professional practice In recent years scholars have concentrated on what makes the internship experience a successful opportunity for the parties involved and have also discussed the crucial role of a mentortutor in sustaining relevant and effective learning However the specific conditions that make tutorship successful in promoting critical reflexivity in such a boundary crossing experience need to be further explored Aim of this paper is therefore to analyze what tutorship conditions sustain the development of critical reflexivity in internship For this purpose we will present the case study of an internship program run by one of the largest universities in northern ItalyAny pedagogy of media practice sits at the intersection between training for employment and education for critical thinking As such the use of projects is a primary means of structuring learning experiences as a means of mirroring professional practice Yet our understanding of the nature of projects and of projectbased learning is arguably undertheorised and largely taken for granted This paper attempts to address this issue through a synthesis of the literature from organisational studies and experiential learning The article aims to shift the debate around projectbased learning away from an instrumentalist agenda to one that considers the social context and lived experience of projects and reconceptualises projects as ontological modalities of doing being and becoming In this way the article aims to provide a means for thinking about the use of projectbased learning within the media practice curriculum that draws on metaphors of discovery rather than of constructionThe present study explored the relation between exchanging social support on online teacher groups and teacher selfefficacy An online survey was conducted inside a massive Facebook teacher group andelementary school teachers provided information regarding Facebook use selfefficacy for creative teaching and the extent to which they provided and received support on the online teacher group Results showed that teacher selfefficacy varied as a function of years of teaching experience length of group membership and the extent to which teachers provided and received social support on the online teacher group Furthermore the providing of online support predicted teacher selfefficacy after taking into account the effects of teaching experience and group membership The findings are discussed in terms of the features and importance of social support exchange on online teacher support groupsThe article announces the appointment of David Watson as associate editor of World Journal of SurgeryObjective The Barrow Innovation Center consists of an educational program that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration among neurosurgery legal and engineering professionals to foster the development of new medical devices This report describes a common issue faced during the placement of ventricular shunts for the treatment of hydrocephalus and the solution to this problem that was developed through the Barrow Innovation Center Methods Neurosurgery residents involved in the Barrow Innovation Center presented the problem of ferromagnetic retractors interfering with pinless imageguidance systems at a monthly meeting Potential solutions were openly discussed by an interdisciplinary committee of neurosurgeons patent lawyers and biomedical engineers The committee decided to pursue development of a novel selfretaining retractor made of nonferromagnetic material as a solution to the problem Results Each retractor design was tested in the cadaver laboratory for size and functionality A final design was chosen and used in a surgical case requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement The new retractor successfully retracted the scalp without interfering with the electromagnetic imageguidance system Conclusions Through the interdisciplinary Barrow Innovation Center program a newly designed dimensionalprinted skin and softtissue retractor was created along with an innovative universal shunt retainer Through this integrated program dedicated to surgical innovation ie the Barrow Innovation Center the process of developing and implementing new technology at our institution has been streamlined creating a culture of innovation within the neurosurgery training programReviews the books A New Narrative for Psychology by Brian

to the RNs competence and confidence to undertake the leadership role when working in residential aged care facilities afterhours and to determine any association of leadership with quality resident outcomes Background Registered nurses RNs working in Residential Aged Care Facilities are required to undertake complex management tasks including leading nursing care teams supervising nonnursing staff and allocating workloads according to residents care needs staff skills and experience Registered nurses plan assess manage medication evaluate each residents care liaise with doctors and allied health professionals and are responsible for evidencebased practice in accordance with the Nursing Standards for PracticeResearchers have commented that effective nurse leadership can improve quality of care improved resident outcomes and reduce adverse events Design A review of original research papers based on the structured methodology described by Kable Pich and MaslinProthero Nurse Education TodayMethods The review was conducted according to the step structured framework by Kable et al Nurse Education TodayThe search included peerreviewed papers published betweenon RN leadership afterhours factors contributing to or with relationships to nursing leadership Nineteen papers were found that researched the impact of leadership in aged care settings Results The literature review concluded that nursing leadership has been linked to the quality of care and clinical outcomes in the aged care setting However RNs in the aged care setting have limited opportunities to develop key leadership competencies and confidence in order to meet the many challenges found in this environment due to lack of access to agedcarespecific leadership education Minimal publications address the importance of the leadership of afterhours RNs Results from this literature review will inform future research in this area Conclusion Nineteen papers identified the leadership required of RNs in aged care settings However limited research investigating the association between nursing leadership and clinical outcomes was found The findings from this literature review suggest that leadership in the aged care setting may be facilitated through specific educational activities such as RN shadowing shifts continuing professional development working with peers and by demonstrating and practising leadership competencies Based on the literature reviewed a need for more research in this area is required In a specific manner research into RN leadership competence and confidence in aged care facilities afterhours is needed Relevance to clinical practice Registered nurses working in the aged care setting afterhours need access to leadership education Better quality of care improved resident outcomes and reduced adverse events are associated with sound leadership PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedResearch Findings Naturalistic instruction is the intentional use of strategies embedded within typical activities of the environment to create learning opportunities for children We used multilevel modeling to analyze data from this singlecase design study that focused on improving teachers use of naturalistic language strategies and childrens communication through professional development with buginear coaching Our results showed that professional development was positively associated with childrens communication during and after professional development During generalization sessions in different types of activities teachers use of the naturalistic language strategies was positively associated with childrens functional communication We also found that children were more likely to communicate during childled activities Practice or Policy Associations among professional development teachers use of evidencebased strategies and childrens outcomes have yet to be fully understood Administrators and professional development providers should support teachers use of naturalistic language strategies to create equitable exposure to languagelearning opportunities for all children Moreover professional development efforts should support teachers intentional use of childled activities to embed languagelearning opportunities based on childrens interests Finally to strengthen childrens generalization of skills across routines professional development providers should identify methods to support teachers generalized use of strategies within the typical activities of the setting PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights

mortality worldwide Early diagnosis and treatment is a key factor in reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes To achieve this it is important to understand the diagnostic pathways of cancer patients Patients from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse CALD are a vulnerable group for lung cancer with higher mortality rates than Caucasian patients The aim of this study is to explore differences in the lung cancer diagnostic pathways between CALD and AngloAustralian patients and factors underlying these differences Methods This is a prospective observational cohort study using a mixedmethod approach Quantitative data regarding time intervals in the lung cancer diagnostic pathways will be gathered via patient surveys General practitioner GP review of general practice records and casenote analysis of hospital records Qualitative data will be gathered via structured interviews with lung cancer patients GPs and hospital specialists The study will be conducted in five study sites across three states in Australia AngloAustralian patients and patients from five CALD groups ie Arabic Chinese Greek Italian and Vietnamese communities will mainly be identified through the list of new cases presented at lung multidisciplinary team meetings For the quantitative component it is anticipated thatpatientsAngloAustralian andCALD patients will be recruited to obtain a final sample of per group assuming apatient survey completion rate and aGP record review completion rate For the qualitative componentinterviews with lung cancer patientsAngloAustralian andpatients per CALD groupinterviews with GPs andinterviews with specialists will be conducted Discussion This is the first Australian study to compare the time intervals along the lung cancer diagnostic pathway between CALD and AngloAustralian patients The study will also explore the underlying patient healthcare provider and health system factors that influence the time intervals in the two groups This information will improve our understanding of the effect of ethnicity on health outcomes among lung cancer patients and will inform future interventions aimed at early diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer particularly patients from CALD backgrounds Trial registration The project was retrospectively registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry registration number extlinkACTRNextlink date registered th July Background Chronic diseases are becoming a huge threat to the Chinese health system Although the New Round of Medical Reform aims to improve this the chronic disease management in rural China is still worrying as it relies highly on hospital care instead of primary care The vertical integrated care model has proven to be effective for chronic disease patients in many highincome countries while few studies have been conducted in China In this project vertical integrated care will be applied to optimize the care of patients with typediabetes mellitus TDM and primary hypertension in rural China and to shift the care from hospital to primary care Methods An educational intervention was conducted in three pilot counties in Jiangsu province a highincome province in southeast China The intervention was based on the model of vertical integrated care between the threelevels of healthcare institutions In the pilot countiestownships were includedin the intervention and control groups respectively Service teams assembled by the local health bureaus implemented the intervention which provides services for both patients and healthcare professionals Questionnaire interviewsn and medical records were used to collect patient data physiological measures healthrelated quality of life satisfaction with care Data from healthcare professionalsn was gathered through questionnaires and indepth interviews knowledge about chronic diseases general procedure of diagnosing and registering chronic disease management situation perceptions of chronic disease treatment and prevention Baseline data were collected before the start of the intervention in Novfollowup data in OctNovand final data completed in JulAugDiscussion The intervention has been conducted smoothly and gotten support from patients healthcare institutions and local health authorities The research team anticipates that the vertical integrated model will improve patients health satisfaction with care and their understanding of their chronic disease We also anticipate that healthcare professionals can acquire more information about chronic diseases and improve their strategy for providing good quality care for patients Trial registration extlinkISRCTNextlink Registration date th April Background Complexity science has been introduced in healthcare as a theoretical framework to better understand complex situations Interdisciplinary healthcare teams can be viewed as Complex Adaptive Systems CAS by focusing more on the team members interaction with each other than on the characteristics of individual team members Viewing teams in this way can provide us with insights into the origins of team behaviour The aim of this study is to describe the functioning of a healthcare team as it originates from the members interactions using the CAS principles as a framework and to explore factors influencing workplace learning as emergent behaviour Methods An interview study was done withpalliative homecare nursescommunity nurses andgeneral practitioners in Flanders Belgium A twostep analysis consisted of a deductive approach which uses the CAS principles as coding framework for interview transcripts followed by an inductive approach which identifies patterns in the codes for each CAS principle Results All CAS principles were identified in the interview transcripts of the three groups The most prevalent principles in our study were principles with a structuring effect on team functioning team members act autonomously guided by internalized basic rules attractors shape the team functioning a team has a history and is sensitive to initial conditions and a team is an open system interacting with its environment The other principles focusing on the result of the structuring principles were present in the data albeit to a lesser extent team members interactions are nonlinear interactions between team members can produce unpredictable behaviour and interactions between team members can generate new behaviour Patterns reflecting team behaviour were recognized in the coding of each CAS principle Patterns of team behaviour identified in this way were linked to interprofessional competencies of the Interprofessional Collaboration Collaborative Factors influencing workplace learning were identified Conclusions This study provides us with insights into the origin of team functioning by explaining how patterns of interactions between team members define team behaviour Viewing healthcare teams as Complex Adaptive Systems may offer explanations of different aspects of team behaviour with implications for education practice and researchWhile there is evidence from nursing and medicine that transition to independent practitioner is challenging and has implications for patient care there is little research exploring novice community pharmacists NCPs transition This study aimed to identify the challenges faced by NCPs at transition to independent practitioner and perceptions of the relative importance of these challenges Nominal group discussions were held between Novemberand Aprilin North West England with purposively sampled NCPs early career pharmacists workbased preregistration tutors and pharmacy support staff In response to the question What are the challenges faced by NCPs at transition participants individually wrote down and subsequently called out in roundrobin fashion then discussed and broadly categorised challenges before ranking them in order of importance Discussions were audiorecorded with consent transcribed and analysed thematically Twentyfive participants from independent supermarket and small and large multiple pharmacies took part in five nominal group discussions Challenges experienced through interacting with the workplace environment were identified as in order of importance relationship management confidence decisionmaking being in charge and accountable and adapting to the workplace With the exception of disagreement between pharmacists and pharmacy support staff regarding whether adapting to the team was challenging for NCPs all participants reported challenges experienced through interacting with the workplace environment Challenges were described as inducing psychosocial stress particularly because NCPs acquired immediate professional accountability worked in isolation from experienced peers and faced jobrelated pressures Interpretation of the findings suggests that the Karasek jobdemandcontrolsupport JDCS model of occupational stress provides valuable insight about transition for NCPs NCPs jobs are classified as high strain where high workplace demands coupled with NCPs lack of control in being able to meet demands together with isolation and lack of support result in transition being characterised as causing isostrain where the workplace becomes a noxious environment PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all

generalists should practice personcentred care for patients of all ages with a wide variety of undifferentiated conditions and should support continuity and coordination of care The aim of this study was to assess the ability of primary care providers to function as medical generalists in the Tygerberg subdistrict of the Cape Town Metropole Methods A randomly selected adult consultation was audiorecorded from each primary care provider in the subdistrict A validated local assessment tool based on the CalgaryCambridge guide was used to scoreskills from each consultation Consultations were also coded for reasons for encounter diagnoses and complexity The coders inter and intrarater reliability was evaluated Analysis described the consultation skills and compared doctors with nurses Resultspractitioners participated response ratewithnurses anddoctors Nurses were older and more experienced than the doctors Doctors saw more complicated patients Good inter and intrarater reliability was shown for the coder with an intraclass correlation coefficient of CIand CIrespectively The overall median consultation score wasIQRThe median consultation score for nurses was CLand for doctors was CL p There was no difference in score with the complexity of the consultation Ten of theskills were not performed in more than half of the consultations Six of theskills were partly or fully performed in more than half of the consultations and these included the more biomedical skills Conclusion Practitioners did not demonstrate a personcentred approach to the consultation and lacked many of the skills required of a medical generalist Doctors and nurses were not significantly different Improving medical generalism may require attention to how access to care is organised as well as to training programmesA systematic review of research published in English was conducted across seven electronic databases in psychology health and social sciences The aim was to ascertain the nature of mental health care workers constructions about culturally and linguistically diverse individuals in order to facilitate provision of culturally appropriate service delivery and multicultural training The constructs and perspectives ofmental health workers with regards to minority populations are represented across thestudies included Key themes comprised Aetiology of Constructions Content of Constructions Factors that Influence Constructions Implications for Cultural Competence Implications for the Therapeutic Alliance Recommendations for Training Recommendations for Practice and Recommendations for Research The therapeutic alliance was most at risk when practitioners displayed low levels of cultural competency and high levels of racial and ethnic blindness The changing and increasingly multicultural context within most countries means that mental health systems and workers need to prepare for an increasing range of culturally and linguistically diverse clients in need of support Recommendations are explored for training practice and researchBackground PatientOriented Research POR is a Canadian initiative for health research that refers to research processes informed by full and active patient involvement in all aspects of the research Ideally POR results in a wide dissemination of the research findings and the uptake of such findings in both clinical practice and health policy The Canadian Institute for Health Research CIHR identifies four stakeholder groups that are involved in POR who are envisioned to take on a collaborative role in enacting this approach to research Those stakeholder groups are patients researchers health care providers and healthcare decisionmakers To achieve collaboration among stakeholders in POR tools resources educationtraining and capacity building are required for each stakeholder group engaged in this work Therefore this review focuses on understanding and articulating competencies needed by participants to engage in POR The aim is to summarize existing knowledge on discrete POR competencies for the four stakeholder groups to support collaboration among them for uptake and strengthening of POR and to inform policy education and future research Accordingly our research question is What are the POR core competencies needed by patients researchers healthcare providers and decisionmakers The main objectives are tosystematically explore the academic and grey literature on competencies needed for these stakeholder groups to engage in PORmap the eligible publications and research gaps in this areagain knowledge to support collaboration among stakeholders andprovide recommendations for further research to use competencies that emerge in developing stakeholder groups readiness to conduct POR Methodsdesign We will use a methodologically rigorous scoping review approach including formulation of the research question and development of the protocol screening and identification of the literature selection of relevant studies data extraction and collation summary and report of the results Our eligibility criteria include elements of population patients researchers healthcare

areas of health care where sufficient researchbased evidence exists and primary health care is no exception In the absence of such evidence the development of assisted support must be based on the opinions and experience of professionals with knowledge of the relevant field The purpose of this research project is to explore how the nominal group technique can be used to establish consensus by analysing how it supported the development of structured knowledgebased electronic health records for preventive child health examinations in Danish general practice Methods We convened an expert panel of five general practitioners with a special interest in the preventive child health examinations We introduced the panel to the nominal group technique a wellestablished structured multistep facilitated group meeting technique used to generate consensus The panel used the technique to agree on the key clinical and socioeconomic themes to include in new electronic records for the seven preventive child health examinations in Denmark The panel met three times over a fourmonth period betweenandand their meetings lasted between twoandahalf and five hours ResultsThe structured and stepwise process of the nominal group technique supported our expert panels focus as well as their equal opportunities to speakThe methods flexibility enabled participants to work as a group and in pairs to discuss and refine thematic classificationsSerial meetings supported continual evaluation critical reflection and knowledge searches enabling our panel to produce a template that could be adapted for all seven preventive child health examinations Conclusion The nominal group technique proved to be a useful method for reaching consensus by identifying key quality markers for use in daily clinical practice Our study focused on the development of content and a layout for systematic knowledgebased electronic health records We recommend the method as a suitable working tool for dealing with complex questions in general practice or similar settings and we present and discuss modifications to the original modelThe article explores the dynamic positionality of international teachers in Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools NIS in Kazakhstan The study draws on indepth interviews withinternational teachers from three NIS schools The findings of the study indicate that on the one hand participants share a fascination with the exciting academic environment and on the other hand they report a degree of disaffection as a result of multiple constraints which prevent them from being fully integrated in the life of the schools The article contributes to the literature on teacher mobility and migration examined from the perspective of Bakhtins dialogical approachThis article is centred on the constructs of teacher quality as defined by early childhood EC teachers in Belize Using the concept of teacher beliefs as a framework the researchers analyse teachers perceptions of quality teaching which should guide policy and practice decisions For this pilot study data were collected fromteachers using openended and Likertscale questions from a questionnaire n or focus groups n Guiding research questions first sought to identify behaviours teachers believed were important or need to be stopped or improved and second to determine teacher agreement with guiding standards for excellence in EC teacher preparation as identified by National Association for the Education of Young Children NAEYC Opencoding and descriptives were used to interpret qualitative and quantitative findings Themes identified by teachers as important EC teacher behaviours and behaviours that needed to be stopped or improved are presented as well as teachers agreement with standards of excellence in EC as identified by NAEYCA Performance and Development Framework has been introduced by the New South Wales Department of Education the largest provider of schooling in Australia during a period of unparalleled reform Engagement with the Framework is mandatory for all the Departments teachers and is linked to improving student outcomes through enhanced teacher professional practice As an initial study of the efficacy of the Performance and Development Framework this article reports a study of teachers understandings of professional learning arising from the first year of the Frameworks implementation Five teaching staff from one school were interviewed three times during the school year to elicit insights into their professional development during experience of the new system Three themes emergedlonger serving teachers and less experienced earlycareer teachers view the professional learning differentlyall the teachers considered the Performance and Development Framework to be a positive developmentalthough there was an uptake of reflective practice understanding of critical reflection as linked to professional learning was limited The study concludes that this mandatory professional development process was generally successful in this context while there is scope for further enhancement specifically in relation to guiding content and reflective practiceEffective feedback is an essential tool for making learning explicit and an essential feature of classroom practice that promotes learner autonomy Yet it remains a pressing challenge for teachers to scaffold the active involvement of students as critical reflective and autonomous learners who use feedback constructively This paper seeks to present a recalibrated perspective of feedback by exploring the concept as a studentinitiated learning action manifested within classroom practice as help seeking for learning Teachers and students from years andat an Australian primary school worked together on a writing project which was structured as a threephase learning process The value of this approach was revealed by data gathered through students planning templates writing samples interviews with students and teachers along with email correspondence with the teachers A framework of social cognitive theory guided the analysis It is suggested that the threephase Assessment as Learning AaL process has the potential to support teachers in scaffolding students to seek help at a time when they are receptive to feedback Furthermore this AaL approach appears to have enhanced the teachers practice particularly in respect to providing support for students during the forethought stage of the learning process Practical techniques for scaffolding students adaptive help seeking and autonomy as learners are presented in the paperWith the majority of undergraduate teaching in Australian higher education being undertaken by casual academics ensuring adequate support for these staff to access support and professional development relating to teaching and learning is imperative In this article we profile the development and implementation of a universitywide strategic framework for training support and recognition of the contributions of sessional teachers The design of this framework was informed through an iterative process of research and consultation with key institutional stakeholders and has resulted in changes at a policy level as well as in the delivery of professional development programs for sessional teaching staff The opportunities and challenges of this approach are discussed as well as future directions and broader considerations for the support of sessional teachers in the Australian higher education contextEducative curricula curriculum materials that intentionally foster teacher professional development can serve as a site for teacher learning through their use in daily instructional practices The present article introduces a framework Teacher Learning Opportunities in Mathematics Curriculum Materials TLOMath for designing and evaluating mathematics curriculum materials educative features according to seven theoretically based variablesmathematics content knowledge for teachingteacher knowledge of student thinking in mathematicsteacher knowledge of disciplinary discourse in mathematicsteacher knowledge of assessment in mathematicsteacher knowledge of differentiated instruction in mathematicsteacher knowledge of technology use in mathematics andteacher knowledge of mathematical community Each variable is illustrated with a definition guiding questions disciplinespecific literature and examples from two sets of elementary mathematics curriculum materials The development of the TLOMath framework is a critical first step for further study of the use of mathematics curriculum materials as sites for teacher learningLearnercentered classrooms encourage critical thinking and communication among students and between students and their instructor and engage students as active learners rather than passive participants However students faculty and experts often have distinct definitions of learnercenteredness and the paucity of research comparing perspectives of these different groups must be resolved In the current study our central research question was how do student faculty and expert observer perceptions of learnercenteredness within biology classrooms compare to one another We sampledstudents from fifteen sections of a general biology course for nonmajors and complete responses fromstudents were analyzed Five valid and reliable tools two faculty two student and one expert observer evaluated the learnercenteredness of each participating section Perceptions of learnercentered instructors often aligned with those of expert observers while student perceptions tended not to align with either group Interestingly students perceived learnercentered instructors as less learnercentered if they taught at nontraditional times andor in largeenrollment sections despite their focus on student learning Perceptions of learnercenteredness in the biology classroom are complex and may be best captured with more than one instrument Our findings encourage instructors to be cognizant that the approaches they employ in the classroom may not be interpreted as learnercentered in the same manner by students and external observers particularly when additional course factors such as enrollment and scheduling may encourage negative perceptions of learnercentered practicesThe article talks about neoliberalism present in young adult dystopias literature The topics addressed include information regarding the documentation of Dystopian fictions contributions to the project of social criticism details about characteristics of the neoliberal economy and about the relationship between the neoliberalism and progressivismThe issue of professional teaching standards has recently generated considerable interest of the Ministry of Education in KSA and elsewhere The purpose of this research paper was to examine the extent to which the Professional Standards for English language teachers are applied by the English language female student teachers at AlImam Muhammed Ibn Saud Islamic University The descriptive method was used The whole population N of all English language senior female student teachers during the second semester was sampled Data were gathered through a questionnaire The participants were asked to evaluate their competencies based on the given items in the questionnaire on apoint Likert scale ranging from incompetent to highly competent Findings revealed that the student teachers perceived themselves to be highly competent in language proficiency with the mean scoresand theoretical knowledgeHowever they were uncertain of their competency in the theoreticalcurriculum designand language pedagogyFindings were discussed in the light of the preparation program syllabus as well as previous related literature Based on the research results recommendations and suggestions for future studies were proposedChange processes focused on improving educational inclusion are a necessary element for schools In this sense cooperative learning appears to be a true innovation for educational institutions giving a valid response for this issue In order to pursue this goal collaborative counseling strategies can be used considering that students cooperation must be aligned with teachers cooperation and with the other agents involved in educational communities One of these strategies is defined according to a number of adaptable phases a creating the conditions in order to face the implementation of the cooperative project and initial assessment of the teaching network b planning and implementation c developing and monitoring the plan d assessing and proposing improvements The main goal of this research was to identify and understand the essential implications of this training proposal To this end we undertook a case study in a school of the Community of Madrid collecting information extracted in interviews focus groups reviewing documents observing and using surveys Results highlighted an impact on three main areas school organization teachers professional development and students learningThe main purpose of this article is to explore the problem of the relationship between theory and practice in initial teacher education within the framework of the Primary Education Degree at the University of Santiago de Compostela This paper is part of a broader research project that aimed to identify analyze and interpret the perceptions of future teachers and their educators on the knowledge they are building in their undergraduate studies and the contribution of these to set a particular professional identity In qualitative terms the study used documentary analysis stories focus groups and interviews with lecturers degree coordinators deans students and practicum tutors during the academic periodRegarding data analysis a deductiveinductive categorization was used carried out with the support of the Atlasti software The analysis and interpretation of the data evidences a model of separation between theory and practice in which theory precedes practice and this is understood as an application of theory This is a situation that generates tensions and dissatisfaction between educators teachers and tutors and students but also the search for alternative strategies for the desirable coimplication between both types of knowledge However the obstacles are more powerful than the desire to change a socially constructed reality in which the twoway dialectical game becomes a principle for actionThis research addresses the problem of teacher shortages in urban highneeds schools A grounded theory methodology was used to expand insights related to teacher recruitment and retention by collecting and analyzing qualitative interview and observational data from nine successful urban teachers A twopart model of recruitment and retention emerged from this analysis The model recommends that recruitment practices should be directed at locating individuals who have specific personality traits the ability to practice cultural awareness and acceptance and who build effective relationships with students Organizational retention practices should be focused on increasing teacher empowerment within an organizational learning frameworkA large body of research supports the efficacy of small group reading interventions for students in Grades K throughHowever there are few studies evaluating the effects of supplemental Tier intervention implemented within a response to intervention RTI or multitiered systems of support MTSS framework The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of providing Tier supplemental intervention to students in Gradesthroughidentified as experiencing reading difficulties n in four elementary schools across four different school districts that were selected to participate in a state MTSS initiative The supplemental intervention was evaluated using a regression discontinuity design and results indicated statistically significant overall effects on measures of phonemic awareness and word decoding and no discernable effects on reading fluency and comprehension Results suggest that supplemental reading intervention implemented within MTSS frameworks can impact key reading outcomes when intervention significantly increases instructional intensityThe field of gifted education has a rich history of proposing and implementing innovative pedagogical practices to develop students creative and critical thinking yet less attention has been given to the assessment of these learning experiences If creative and critical thinking are both inherently important in developing global problem solvers and further represent the goals of gifted curriculum then classroom assessments must be designed to measure student development of these process skills Many assessment rubrics emphasize the end product or superficially address process skills This article provides sample rubrics to assess creative and critical thinking skills independently Then we consider anchoring larger projects assessment within the Design Thinking Model DTM which embeds creative and critical thinking skills into the design process Teachers may tailor these rubrics to assist in measuring the essential yet complex cognitive processes and clearly convey to students the characteristics and practices of a good thinker and designerThe existing elearning system simply presents a large number of learning resources to learners without considering the needs of students personalized learning resulting in the problem of resource selection In view of the above problems and the shortcomings of primary school English learning system the personalized English learning system based on the ebook mode was designed and implemented Through the design of ubiquitous resource aggregation model course learning resource learning collaborative learning unit testing question answering system and other functions were integrated tightly together to provide a fully personalized teaching environment for learners and teachers The results of the system test were analyzed and the improvement direction of the theoretical research and practical development was proposedConsidering the significant position of critical pedagogy in teaching English as a foreign language there is a need for indepth investigations of novice teachers professional identity construction through the interaction with critical notions introduced in teacher education programs As the impact of such programs on novice teachers professional identity in an EFL context has remained underexplored this study intends to address the gap This study examines the role of a teacher education program informed by the principles of critical pedagogy in influencing novice EFL teachers professional identity construction Participants werenovice EFL teachers whose process of professional identity construction was analysed through reflective journals class discussions and semistructured interviews before and after the program Results of the study revealed two major shifts in participants professional identity Before the program their identity was characterized by an attitude of compliance and a narrow view of EFL teaching However after the program they developed voice and adopted a humanistic conception of teaching Finally in order to facilitate the cultivation of critical ideas in EFL novice teachers the study recommends the use of dialogic discussions and written reflective tasks in teacher education programsThe purpose of this study is to explore the metaphorical perceptions of science teacher candidates towards teacher and teaching profession Qualitative research method was used in the study and phenomenological approach was employed as the design of the study The participants of the study are comprised ofteacher candidates who pursue science education programs in the fall term ofacademic year in the department of mathematics and science education of a middlesized faculty of education in Central Anatolia As data collection tool a form consisting ofquestions was used for the identified concepts The obtained data were analyzed using content analysis technique and after the accuracy of the determined metaphors and created the categories were controlled by two faculty members having expertise the final form of metaphor and the categories were generated As a result of the analyses it was found out that teacher candidates generatedmetaphors for teacher concept andmetaphors for teaching profession Given the data obtained it has been observed that prospective teachers provided positive metaphors for the concept of teaching and teaching professionTo achieve the purpose of inquiry learning approaches and models it is necessary to identify the difficulties encountered because the science teacher candidates have key prescriptions Therefore the aim is to reflect fruitful and high level critical views at the end of the process providing them different learning difficulties using different learning models and approaches at every stages For this purpose qualitative research method was used in the study conducted withcandidates selected from easily accessible case sample among the thirdgrade students attending the undergraduate program of science teacher education Openended form was prepared as a data collection tool and the data were generated using content analysis Finally the answers given by the teacher candidates are thematized as advantages disadvantages cognitive domain skills affective domain SETSE dimension TQF The codes generated under the themes vary according to the applied model and approach The nature of science team work and discussion culture code were most evident in CMCK While the STS code was on the forefront in E model the engineering and design skills code was found to be at a high level in STEM implementationNationwide agricultural education has experienced a shortage of qualified schoolbased agriculture teachers for over four decades Students who seek careers as agriculture teachers are often those who participated in agricultural education and FFA in high school The Ag Ed FITChoiceModel LawverLawverTorreswas used as the investigative framework for this phenomenological study which sought to explore how active participation in schoolbased agricultural education programs influenced students choice to major in agricultural education and pursue a career in teaching Seven agricultural education majors who participated in agricultural education and FFA in high school participated in a focus group interview Transcripts of the focus group interview were analyzed and coded for thematic content using open axial and selective coding protocols Five themes emerged from the data which includedsocializer influencerssocial valuepassion for agriculturealignment with personal values andagricultural education factors The agricultural education factors theme was broken into four subthemes which include agriculture teacher encouragement FFA events increased selfefficacy through a quality program and posthigh school opportunities Based on the findings implications and recommendations for recruitment are discussedThe purpose of this study was to describe the development of content and performance standards for a rubric to evaluate secondarylevel solo instrumental music performance using a modified bookmark standard setting procedure The research questions that guided this study includeWhat are the psychometric qualities of a rubric to evaluate secondarylevel solo instrumental music performanceWhat is the quality of ratings obtained for the standardsetting panel of subject matter expert judgesWhat cut scores best categorize secondarylevel solo instrumental performances into four performance levels across the latent performance achievement variable andWhat content mastery of items best categorizes achievement in secondarylevel solo music performance at each of the four performance levels A panel of eight subject matter experts participated in the study A item rubric was used to collect the judging panels observed responses The collected responses were transformed to linear measures using the multifaceted Rasch partial credit model The bookmark procedure resulted in the setting of three cut points representing minimum pass levels on a latent continuum differentiating between four performance achievement levels rudimentary emerging proficient and exemplary with clearly defined content standards Implications for opportunity to learn are discussedThe current models of teacher education in the Western world are still largely based upon the building of students knowledge and skills using approaches similar to those designed for the assembly lines of the past The prevailing model of schooling is still centered around the notion that schools are places young people go to watch their teacher work In the advent of the innovation age teacher education requires reinvention around the emerging knowledge base about learning and the key role teachers play in addressing issues of equity and student success in this rapidly changing and complex world A panel of eminent international scholars from a range of fields formulated evidencebased frameworks to guide future teacher education models globally The frameworks focus on learning equity In addition the team launched a cloudbased Learning Equity Research and Resource Center hosting some of the planets best scholarly and applied research on learning sciences and equitybased practices The teams research agenda is grounded in learning theory cognitive science technology social justice and an equity mission to provide learning environments and quality teachers that enable the potential of all children The Global Learning Equity Network GLEN challenges the preparation of a new kind of teacher for a new kind of school one built on a learning center rather than a testing center model GLENs research resources and frameworks are designed to assist new teachers to enable all children to discover their passions grow their talents and be inspired to lead healthy happy and productive livesAssessment is a central function of the teachinglearning cycle and a key performance standard for beginning and experienced teachers Especially in todays school climate of highstakes teacher evaluation physical education will continue to be at risk unless programs can begin to provide evidence of student learning The Systematic Observation of Formal Assessment of Students by Teachers SOFAST instrument was developed for the purpose of collecting process data on various dimensions of teachers formal and informal assessment practices SOFAST is a threelevel observation system that allows users to collect data on teachers primary teaching functions including formal and informal assessment the focus of their assessment and common contextual dimensions of lessons Seven secondarylevel licensed physical education teachers were observed over three regular lessons Percentages were calculated for each SOFAST category Individual and group means and standard deviations were calculated Secondary physical education teachers employ mostly informal assessment strategies and limit their formal assessment to student efforts on managerial aspects of performanceThis article reports the results of a study whose purpose was to trace the configuration of professional subjectivities by analyzing the narratives of four Colombian nonnative English speaking teachers in the framework of language policies In this qualitativenarrative study we used written narratives and narrative interviews as instruments to collect data from the participants who work in different universities and schools in Colombia Their stories were analyzed using short story analysis and the results allowed us to identify a core category Recreating the self An entangled changeable and endless process which shows that the subjectivities are influenced by others teachers go through processes of acceptance or rejection when configuring them and knowledge and reflection play an important roleThis paper presents one Colombian university English as a foreign language programs inhouse teacher development program for curriculum renewal This program is an innovative attempt to prepare teachers for implementing a new curriculum and simultaneously engages them in professional development activities The program is a response to the lack of existing teacher and professional development models that fit certain specific contextual needs including preparation for implementing new curriculum as well as emphases in the updating of particular teaching practices In addition to presenting the program the article also describes the integration of key aspects of various existing models of teacher and professional development into one program that meets contextual needs while encouraging positive change among faculty and studentsTeachers beliefs about teaching and learning are constructed over a lifetime of experiences in classrooms This nineyear longitudinal study examines preservice teachers initial educational beliefs and the changes in those beliefs over their teacher preparation program and into their first six years of teaching Analysis of questionnaires interviews and surveys from six teachers revealed that they initially believed that students were similar to themselves that students in the same grade have similar abilities that teaching was simple and that teachers function autonomously Nine years later they believed that students differ from one another and from themselves that differentiating instruction is essential but difficult that teaching is complex and that teaching is often constrained by outside factors The data suggested a common progression from initial idealism to cognitive dissonance to a search for an authentic teaching persona to confidence in their new role as teacher and then to diminished idealismThe lack of preparation for cooperating teachers is a longstanding problem in teacher education as is the haphazard nature and quality of field experiences This study ofpreservice andcooperating teachers inuniversitybased credentialing programs in California examined the difference preparation made in how cooperating teachers enacted their role as well as the relationship between preservice teachers perceptions of cooperating teacher practice and their ratings of their field experience A significant finding was that cooperating teachers who received preparation for their role reported greater enactment of practices overall and in particular practices related to prompting reflection and goal setting Preservice teachers field ratings strongly correlated to their perceptions of cooperating teacher practice Implications are for design and implementation of professional development for cooperating teachers to improve field experience qualityThe quality of experiential learning in distance education is a dominant concern of all major stakeholders and the public at large Institutions of higher learning which train school teachers at a distance are often blamed for the poor quality of teachers and teaching The perception among some sections of the society is that teachers trained at a distance are of poor quality compared to those trained via the conventional facetoface mode While this perception can be disputed it gives distance education institutions food for thought Debunking the wrong perception is to ensure quality in the training of teachers at a distance Students of the University of South Africa UNISA are scattered all over the country and beyond and this makes effective and quality organization managing supervision mentoring and evaluation of experiential learning quite daunting Effective experiential learning cannot be organized and managed effectively without the involvement of key stakeholders This paper used the qualitative research approach to explore the views of major stakeholders from two Provinces in South Africa on quality assurance of experiential learning for teacher trainees in distance education The findings indicate that all the major stakeholders involved in providing experiential learning in the UNISA teacher training program support the idea of collaboration as the basis of quality teacher trainingThe article examines the challenges facing US school districts as they attempt to purchase science textbooks that align with the Next Generation Science Standards NGSSThis article describes how a secondary teacher education program at a midsized university made the turn toward a practicebased program in teacher education The authors argue that efforts to recenter the program around practices have not only improved opportunities for novice teachers but also have provided teacher educators a programmatic framework for making substantive progress toward three attributes of quality teacher education increased collaboration between teacher educators greater coherence between courses and experiences and improved legitimacy of universitybased teacher education The authors detail specific components of this program reform and explain how such efforts have resulted in valuable gains across each attribute The authors also explain how they implemented these programmatic changes largely within existing course and fieldexperience structures and without substantive new infusions of personnel or fundingThe central role of mentoring in developing and preparing prospective teachers during the clinical experience has been consistently documented in the literature Screening candidates and selecting the fittest to serve as mentors is an essential process to the successful provision of the necessary professional and personal assistance to the new entrants to the profession Based on this premise the present conceptual paper aims to provide a new perspective to the selection process of mentor teachers to support preservice English as a Foreign Language EFL teachers in the Moroccan context At the current time the only formal requirements for becoming a mentor are based on a simple expression of interest and a consideration of the academic qualifications the candidate has This method of selection proved to be problematic in light of new empirical evidence that showed its inherent limitedness and how it created unnecessary difficulties for trainee teachers during practice teaching The Trispheric Ecological Approach to Mentor Selection TEAMS framework this paper tries to put forward adds more layers to the screening process of mentor teachers and places it in a wider context with more important factors and players to consider This approach is then hoped to enhance the quality of mentoring during the practicum and circumvent numerous reported problems that preservice teachers unnecessarily have to endure under the current mentor selection processThe purpose of the study is to determine the communicative approaches used by preservice teachers in science teaching For this purpose a week training program was developed and applied to raise the preservice teachers awareness of dialogic teaching and communicative approach Before and after this training program one lesson of each preservice teacher was videorecorded These videos were analyzed on the basis of four classes of communicative approach developed by Mortimer and ScottIn line with the purpose of the study the discourse analysis method was employed to determine the communicative approach used by the preservice teachers Moreover the preservice teachers were asked to watch their lessons videorecorded before and after the implementation of the training program and to write which communicative approach they used in these lessons and why they used this approach The findings of the current study revealed that the preservice teachers mostly preferred the authoritative approach before the training program yet after the training program besides the authoritative approach they started to use dialogic interactionbased communicative approach in their lessons Their reasons for

Assessment Frameworks at the End of Key Stageand the Key StageEnglish Grammar Punctuation and Spelling Tests I employ an object of comparison a philosophical method for attitudes towards literacy and dyslexics I challenge current conceptions of the Othering of and discrimination against dyslexics I argue for the concept of Lexism as an alternative explanatory account for the existence of dyslexicsThe article analyzes foreign experience in continuing professional development of teachers It has been found that the system of continuing professional development of teachers in foreign countries has its own conceptual peculiarities determined by relevant contextual factors It has been specified that all systems are characterized by personalityoriented approach to professional development of teachers available organizational and pedagogical conditions for development flexibility diversity of forms and training content Such an approach can enhance professionalism of teachers their ability to provide students with highquality and effective teaching in accordance with the needs of a market economy It has been outlined that professional development of teachers is the most effective at the level of an educational institution in the course of daily teaching activities provided the forms of this process organization are diverse The key factor which influences effectiveness of continuing professional development is the teachers ability to reflect motivation responsibility and academic mobility within professional development It has been clarified that a number of countries apply national mechanisms for recognizing the results of teachers professional development their certification We believe it necessary to creatively use foreign innovative experience to enhance continuing professional development of teachers in Ukraine namely to create a multilevel system of continuing professional development of vocational education teachers and introduce motivational mechanisms for stimulating their professional growthThe importance of the research related to the existence of collaborative learning in higher education for Latinos specifically preservice teachers has been substantiated It has been defined that while teacher retention rates for Latinos are lower than for whites using teamwork in the classroom might make Latinos teaching more rewarding Most participants in the present study preferred collaborative learning as teachers Using cognitive and socialconstructivist frameworks the authors provide trends expressed byundergraduate preservice teachers about traditional tests and cooperative culminating experiences Since archival data from regular collaborative pedagogies over a year period have been used the authors did not include identifying information However about of undergraduates are firstgeneration Latinocollege students Students responses to endofcourse surveys have been analyzed The two major qualitative themes emerging from grounded theory analysis were social interaction and the cognitive domain Quantitatively most preferred group presentations over traditional exams Statistically significant correlations between Variablesperceived retention of material andpreferred culminating experience as future teachers Variablesperceived retention of material andculminating experience for an easy A and Variablespreferred culminating experience as future teachers andculminating experience for an easy A have been found Implications relate to designing more collaborative activities for nondominant college students As the result of the conducted research it has been determined that collaborative learning needs to be well planned students need to be prepared to work in groups and teachers expectations need to be stated explicitly if the benefits attributed to collaborative learning are to be realizedThis article uses critical discourse analysis in order to discuss the equity and social justice implications of an envisaged education reform agenda in Cyprus as articulated by two consultation reports commissioned by the World Bank The reports highlight italicinter aliaitalic the imperative to improve teaching and enhance accountability regimes with regard to students learning Selected extracts from these documents are analyzed in order to highlight the absence of a social justice discourse in the rhetoric of educational reforms despite the alleged centrality of a social justice discourse in official policy The reports fail to include issues of social justice and learner diversity in discussing the necessity to strengthen the existing teacher policy framework and to mobilize structural educational reforms This omission is indicative of the neoliberal imperatives that drive the envisaged education policy reforms as well as the low priority attributed to issues of equity and learner diversity with particular reference to students designated as having special educational needs andor disabilitiesUnprecedented changes to family life in the new millennium have left many parents feeling unable to effectively participate in their childs schoolbased learning This article presents research which explored enablers and impediments when using social media as part of an inquiry curriculum to promote parent engagement in student learning in one Australian school Using collaborative inquiry research various data were collected from two earlyyears teachers their students and the students parents using surveys a fullday meeting online weekly meetings interviews and the social media digital platform of Seesaw Rogoffs three interrelated planes of sociocultural analysispersonal interpersonal and communitywere used to examine participant interactions and their effects The agencystructure dialectic provided a conceptual lens to further explain how the social media apparatus of Seesaw enabled learning and teaching The findings showed that access to forms of language needed to contribute to online social media spaces drew attention to the importance of teachers having at the ready a substantive knowledge of inquiry Implications for future research are discussedEven though its importance is underscored in many research pursuits attention to the affective domain in learning is often neglected at the expense of the cognitive development of students studying science in particular physics In this paper we propose a framework the pedagogical technological integrated medium PTIM founded on the TPACK model that builds on the existing premises of pedagogy content and technology to make space for the affective domain where these three premises intersect with each other We operationalize the PTIM framework through a multiloop model that explores the affective dimension as an overarching space for interaction among learners teachers and parents through a series of stages encompassing home tasks as well as classroom and outofschool activities Within the qualitative paradigm we substantiate from two case studies an exploratory and an evaluative one in two different schools that a succinct synchronisation of these various interactive elements promotes knowledge construction springing from the affective domain in terms of motivation interest and values and also from their interrelationshipsThis research examines how public school principals in seven US states perceive the proficiency exam they must take and pass in order to evaluate their teachers The test is centered on the states primary teaching evaluation system which is based on Charlotte Danielsons Tramework for Teaching An online survey was developed andout of overworking principals across seven states responded yielding a response rate of nearlyStates were selected to represent a cross section of high middle and low scorers in the annual education Week Quality Counts report Education WeekResults showed that most principals were not satisfied with the proficiency test that they must take and pass in order to evaluate their staffs Many principals called for the elimination or drastic overhaul of their proficiency exam Suggested changes also showed that most principals wanted better quality videos they must watch to evaluate teaching lessons and they also wanted the test to be less subjective The survey showed that more principals than not believed the test was unfair and should not stay the sameThis study explored the perspectives of mathematics teacher educatorresearchers MTERs on the use of theory in facilitating teacher growth We adopted the framework of the theorycentered scholarship triangle SilverHerbst xrefxref to probe the underlying meanings of perspectives on theory use expressed by MTERs Qualitative analysis revealed three distinct types of perspectives a perspective focusing on research a perspective focusing on practice and a perspective on the connection between research and practice For the perspective on the connection between research and practice two subcategories were identified connection with consideration of context and that without consideration of context Different perspectives that MTERs possess may influence their actions taken in professional development and consequently influence teachers learning of theory Specifically the cyclic process of decontextualizing and recontextualizing theory between research and practice domains is the key to the development of MTERs educative power so that they can better facilitate teachers in learning theoryThe article deals with using the educational potential of extracurricular work in foreign language while developing personal and professional skills of students at higher agricultural education institutions The terms of the efficiency of educational extracurricular work are defined and its forms and methods are considered The examples of different extracurricular events in foreign language aimed at the education of future specialist personality are providedThis article examines four French immersion FI teachers perspectives on the relationship between language and culture and on their roles as intercultural mediators in New Brunswick NB Canadas only officially bilingual province Data were drawn from semistructured interviews with the teachers Couched in the broader framework of Canadas multicultural policy the cultural outcomes for NBs FI program underscore the importance of learning French in a multicultural and multilingual society Understanding the relationship between language and culture is part of this however the department explicitly states that it does not intend for immersion students to adopt Francophone culture This analysis shows that these teachers employ a variety of language ideologies all of which culminate in a languageascode approach devoid of culture and removed from its social contexts of use They do not consider deep cultural discussions to have a place in their classrooms although each teacher demonstrates some level of intercultural awareness regarding the languageculture dialectic in their private lives The works by Kohler Di Stefano and Kearney are employed to consider possible ways forward for teacher training on intercultural mediation in immersion classrooms and on curriculum development to target students intercultural competenceProgress monitoring in inclusive preschool classrooms should describe all childrens progress towards general curriculum outcomes and individual childrens unique outcomes or IEP goals This research study used the Childrens School Success Curriculum Framework CSS Curriculum Framework and progress monitoring process to assess the outcomes ofchildren on these dimensions Childrens progress monitoring data were analyzed within groupings based on instructional need level ie low medium or high in academic content and social domains Progress monitoring findings for both the academic and social support level of need groups showed significant progress pre to posttest on most academic outcomes but some variation with less consistent gains within the social emotional domain Goal attainment scaling data demonstrated childrens gains toward achieving their social goals individualized education program IEP or specific learning goals were at the expected level betweenandof the time Academicfocused goal attainment was at or above the expected level of betweenandof the time based on the learning grouping Teacher implementation of CSS Curriculum Framework appeared to impact change in classroom and instructional practices prepost interventionInthe AAIDD National Goals panel recommended the inclusion of the Universal Design for Learning UDL framework in services designed to support the needs of learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities IDD As a framework that can be implemented districtschoolwide little is known about the implementation process and administrators experiences with implementation Less is known regarding the experiences of administrators as they implement the framework with learners who struggle or have identified disabilities To better understand these experiences in implementation researchers conducted interviews with eighteen school principalsdistrict personnel in a district recognized for fully implementing UDL A subset of questions from these interviews focused specifically on efforts in implementation to include the needs of learners that are struggling or that have identified disabilities This research analyzes responses from those administrators specific to supporting students with disabilities Findings are shared including those specific to the inclusion of individuals with IDD Implications for future research and practice are providedEfforts to recruit and retain effective teachers of color have spread into the field of special education However scant research examining the experiences of teachers of color enrolled in special education teacher preparation inclusion programs exists In the current study a phenomenological investigation ofpreservice Black students at predominately White higher education institutes in special education teacher programs designed to train teachers for inclusive classrooms was conducted to understand their experiences and identify effective recruitment and retention strategies Based on the findings students reported five themes a feeling alienated in their programs b feeling that they need effective mentoring from faculty of color c better relationships with other peers of color d deliberate mission of the institute and program and e better need for financial support The implications for recruiting and retaining Black teachers in special education and directions for future research were discussedThe article discusses the learning method which is based on Exeters Harkness approach that groups students to solve problems in their own ways It states that students are complaining about the approach but as they persevere students are gradually inducted into a new way of thinking about math and they come to see themselves as the authorityIn the teaching process of Urban and Rural Planning students not just need to learn relevant theoretical knowledge but also should flexibly apply relevant theoretical knowledge to practice urban and rural planning Virtual simulation technology can construct the teaching situation which organically combines theory and practice for the course of Urban and Rural Planning help students deepen the understanding of theoretical knowledge and enhance theoretical knowledge application and practice ability so as to make up for the defects in Urban and Rural Planning teaching Thus virtual simulation technology was integrated in Urban and Rural Planning teaching to form the complete teaching mode in this paper Practical teaching application shows the teaching mode has good effect on improving students theoretical knowledge study and practical abilityEcoJustice Education is both a framework for thinking about our ethical responsibilities as educators and community members and a socioecological and political movement In this essay I trace my own personal history in the development of this field focusing on the theoretical foundations major scholars contributing to those founding ideas and a number of concrete practical manifestations in organizations curricula programs and institutions I begin the essay with a focus on relationality as a particularly important concept in the epistemological ontological and ethical frames that make up this particular approach to teacher educationCollaboration with parents is widely regarded as important in the education of children and young people yet teachers rarely feel sufficiently prepared for this task Several studies indicate that initial teacher education ITE programmes struggle to address issues of familyschool partnerships FSP Our purpose in this study was to assess whether national ITE frameworks in seven European countries enable or constrain effective FSP preparation for preservice teachers Our data drawn from document analysis and national surveys suggests that despite the importance officially attributed to FSP at both governmental and ITE institutional levels no single country presents a satisfactory picture in terms of FSP provision within their ITE programmes or in the extent to which preservice teachers are prepared to deal with the issue Regardless of the existence or not of a national curriculum and variations both in terms of legallyrequired competences and the amount of attention given to FSP in ITE programmes it appears that simply making FSP compulsory is not the solution Nor do national frameworks in themselves really appear to shape and direct the provision offered Essentially FSP preparation still seems to depend upon the proclivities and expertise of individual teacher educatorsThe purpose of this study was to explore student teachers images of science instruction in informal settings and how these images explicate their field trip pedagogy italicField tripsitalic refers to planned structured and adaptable ways of learning science outside the science classroom that are connected to the school science curriculum italicField trip pedagogyitalic collectively refers to pre during and postfield trip pedagogies and teachers decisionbased actions central to making connections between inschool science and outofschool science An analysis of drawing and narrative data indicated that a field trips were predominantly situated within the schoolyard and b science instruction during field trips as social constellations of students and the teacher learning science content that was disconnected from school science Implications include the need for teacher educators a to use a framework to examine their student teachers prior knowledge of field trip pedagogies b to help their student teachers reflect more carefully on the pedagogy within informal settings regardless of the location of the lesson and c to help their student teachers construct the knowledge that science instruction within informal settings is connected to inschool scienceTeacher assessment has been recently considered as a minor issue in Education Therefore there is lacks teachers competency assessment as the basis for the sustainability of teacher profession development This study was on attempt to describe the model of teacher assessment which had been implemented in Indonesia and its challenges to encourage the development of a sustainable teacher profession The data was collected through documentation Moreover some interviews were conducted aboutteacher competency test inbyteachers inbyteachers and inbyteachers andteacher development programs as a followup of teacher competency tests The obtained data was analized by descriptive quantitative and qualitative respectively on the document study result data and the interviews The teacher competency test results were used to measure the mastery of pedagogic and professional competence of teachers at all subject matter and all levels of schools in Indonesia Furthermore the results are used as the basis for determining teacher quality improvement program in Indonesia continuous training They are expected to provide best practice information from the implementation of teacher competency mapping done in Indonesia including its followup in order to develop the teachers sustainable professionThis article presents a conceptual metaphor analysis of teachers social images in a group of Chilean preservice teachers The theoretical framework is based on conceptual metaphors The aims of the study are to describe the metaphoric categories per cohort of students to establish similarities and differences and to determine the stability of the obtained metaphoric categories Fromtoa written prompt was administered to first year preservice teachers and inthis instrument was also given to fifth year preservice teachers to whom a focus group interview was run to deepen the information provided by the written prompt A scale was given to them afterwards to classify the metaphoric categories according to their level of representation The results show that social and professional context factors have an impact on the confi guration of the concepts with which the participants think teachers are represented by societyBackground We describe an interprofessional educator development program designed intentionally that was implemented at an academic healthcare centre Inwe purposefully adapted our preexisting educator development program to be able to include all interprofessional educators at our institution The programs goals were to enhance educator skills acommon need due to requirements of accreditation and to create alocal interprofessional community of teachers The framework of the program was based upon adult learning principles reflective practice experiential learning and peer groups all key characteristics of faculty development programs It was also longitudinal and immersive Kirkpatricks program evaluation model was used for identifying results participants selfreported evaluation forms were collected and their narrative comments were analyzedResults After we opened our educator program to all interprofessional staff our number of program participants increased The interprofessional participants included but was not limited to physicians physician trainees nurses physician assistants audiologists perfusionists and basic science researchers Our number of program sessions and program faculty were expanded Our interprofessional participants reported that they were able to learn essential knowledge skills and attitudes for their growth and development as educators in the context of an interprofessional community while also appreciating the diversity of their peersDiscussion We share our insights with the redesign and implementation of an interprofessional educator program so that others can learn from our experiences Key takeaways include using aconceptual framework for teaching effectiveness involving interprofessional stakeholders and obtaining their perspectives reviewing interprofessional literature and competencies and highlighting best practices across the disciplinesCultivating a culture of higherorder thinking has been one of the desired outcomes in the field of education for many decades However the rapid development in technology has recently made critical thinking hereafter CT an emphasized st century educational goal This goal changed the role of teachers from transferring information to preparing students for information processing by exercising critical judgment and creative thinking Like in other fields the prominence of fostering this skill is acknowledged in English Language Teaching On the other hand to what extent prospective English teachers who are the future gatekeepers in facilitating learners thinking skills are aware of the ways they could merge CT with their teaching and how much they could transfer such awareness into practice needs to be investigated Thus the present study comprising of an action research design explored the impact of a week action plan implementation onpreservice English teachers awareness and teaching practices regarding the integration of CT into language teaching Data collection involved the use of CT tasks semistructured interviews lesson plans videorecorded macro teachings and selfreflection journals Both quantitative analysis in the form of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis in the form of content analysis were performed to scrutinize the results The findings indicated gradual perceptual improvement about the concept and how to integrate it into language teaching This was also reflected in teaching practices of the participants thanks to sufficient and appropriate guidance despite some reported external and internal obstaclesThe dynamic model of educational effectiveness refers to eight factors that describe teachers instructional role A multidimensional framework for measuring both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of teaching factors is also proposed Empirical support for the validity of the model has been provided which revealed that the teaching factors can be grouped into five stages situated in developmental order In this study for the first time a qualitative methodology is used to provide an indepth analysis of three videolessons through the perspective of the five stages of effective teaching Thus we present how each stage is defined and use the cases of the three videolessons to justify the rationale for these stages and help readers see how observational data are used to identify individual improvement priorities and provide differentiated feedback even to teachers allocated to the same stage Finally based on the qualitative analysis of the three casestudies strengths and limitations of the dynamic model to evaluate quality of teaching for formative reasons are identifiedThe article presents questions and answers related to education in Great Britain including national funding arrangements for adult

educationalrelated parliamentary questions to the House of Commons Department for Education DfE in Great Britain The topics discussed include the eligibility for support for the diverse national funcing on adult education the DfEs funding policy from the digital vouchers of the Apprenticeship Levy that firms did not expend with the time limit of two years and the number of companies in England that failed to spend their apprenticeship levyIn many parts of the world newly hired science teachers practices are developing in a complex policy environment However little is known about how newly hired science teachers practices are enacted throughout a cycle of instruction and how these practices can be influenced by macro meso and micropolicies Knowing how policies impact practice can result in better policies or better support for certain policies in order to enhance the instruction of newly hired teachers This comparative study investigated hownewly hired science teachers at sites in South Africa SA and the United States US progressed through an instructional cycle of planning teaching and reflection The qualitative data were analysed through beginning teacher competency frameworks the cycle of instruction and institutional theory Data analysis revealed prevailing areas of practice and connections to levels of policy within the instructional cycle phases There were some differences between the SA and US teachers and among first second and thirdyear teachers More importantly this study indicates that newly hired teachers are susceptible to micropolicies and are progressively developing their practice It also shows the importance of mesolevel connectors It suggests that teacher educators and policy makers must consider how to prepare and support newly hired science teachers to achieve the shared global visions of science teachingThe article presents an Editorial which discusses about significant transformations happening in the economic social and

and indepth reading of the induction governance model in Italy and its qualiquantitative evaluation this work will attempt to validate or enrich governance principles to be applied to similar implementation contexts Starting from the governance conditions recognized as fundamental to an effective induction programme one of the goals of this work is to understand how the conditions of success have been implemented in the Italian training model and above all how they have been characterized with respect to the design of network governanceOnline didactics for adults has to meet the needs of an audience with peculiar constraints and goals In particular within a constructivist and connectionist perspective it has to ensure the right balance between autonomy and socialization while stimulating reflection upon experience and generating further meaningful experiences In this contribution we present the educational model of the Italian University Line as an example of online didactics meeting the above defined requirements also in the case of ITEInitial Teacher Education Finally we present an ongoing experimentation of gamification aiming at enhancing engagement and motivationThis paper presents the results of eMEL a European project aiming at promoting the development implementation and testing of training scenarios for pre and inservice teachers training in the field of digital and media literacy education The analysis of the results led the research team to identify the critical and successful aspects of the testing and to draw some recommendations for the future implementation of teacher training interventions The final goal is to reflect on sustainable models of media and digital skills training both in terms of teacher education and teachers professional developmentThe present study aims at investigating the impact of visual contextual support and Glossary of Words on EFL learners vocabulary learning For this purpose a total number ofmale preuniversity students were randomly selected after administering the English proficiency test to assure the homogeneity of the participants The learners were assigned to three homogeneous groupsexperimental groups namely visual contextual support and glossary of words and one control group to highlight the comparative purposes During treatment the first experimental group received a passage including new vocabulary items and visual contextual supports as treatment and the second experimental group received the same passage including new vocabulary items and the glossary of words as treatment On the other hand the control group received no treatment and they were just given the new vocabulary items of the same passages given to the experimental groups in order to guess the meaning of new words only by using their own vocabulary knowledge To compare the probable differential impact of the study a pretest and posttest were applied to all three groups and the results of the tests were contrasted and analysed For data analysis the oneway ANOVA was administered for pretest and posttest The results of the study demonstrated a significant improvement of vocabulary learning through utilizing visual contextual support in comparison to the glossary of words group and moreover than the control groupIt has often been said that any student engagement that is poorly monitored during teaching practice TP will not necessarily contribute much to their professional development and teacher identity This applies specifically to initial undergraduate teacher training This concern became the main focus of the study on which this article is reporting as part of a broader projectFIRE Fourthyear Initiative for Research in Education which commenced inWe wanted to determine how we could complement a community of practice engagement by using Participatory Reflection and Action PRA as intervention that could eventually contribute to the development of student teachers teacher identity during teaching practice This article reports on the outcomes of a study conducted on a sample offinalyear student teachers betweenandat a tertiary institution in Pretoria Data were generated by participating student teachers during threehour oncampus workshops approximately a quarter of the way into their teaching practice They were required to respond to a single question by addressing how student teachers perceive the roles of expert teachers in terms of their curriculum and subject knowledge their expertise in teaching and learning caring and providing learner support and the managerial and professional skills of teachers The results confirmed that PRA is a dynamic research and data collection strategy to create networks through which participants can benchmark their experiences against peers and other stakeholders Furthermore it is again confirmed that traditional TP experiences often fail to expose student teachers adequately to the full dynamics of the educational landscape as certain interactions and activities are conflictdependent and only emerge when opposing and conflicting forces create imbalances and inequity PRA drew our attention to serious flaws in our teacher training programmes urging a reassessment of the objectives and actions of TPGroup comparisons offer students opportunities to reason about many fundamental statistical concepts like center variation or distribution When doing such activities using large real datasets technology becomes an essential tool for exploring the data With its large variety of features and its userfriendly handling TinkerPlotsTMas a software for learners and teacherscan facilitate the process of comparing distributions In this article we focus on eight preservice teachers reasoning when comparing groups with TinkerPlots We present ideas on the design of a course to develop statistical reasoning with TinkerPlots present a framework to rate learners performance when comparing groups with TinkerPlots and present results of a laboratory study about preservice teachers reasoning when comparing groups with TinkerPlots Findings suggest that the TinkerPlots tool and design of the course supported these preservice teachers reasoning and that more learning opportunities are needed to increase their group comparison elements repertoire and interpretation in contextThis article contributes to a reconceptualization of pedagogical content knowledge through exploring what is entailed in teachers understanding of content within the framework of the institutional curriculum with a central concern for the development of human powers capacities or abilities ways of thinking understanding worlds The contribution is made by way of a curriculum making framework and through examining the capabilities approach and Bildungcentered Didaktik The central thesis is that a teacher necessarily interprets the content contained in the institutional curriculum identifying its elementary elements and ascertaining its educational potential The interpretation calls for curriculum thinking informed by a theory of contentBackground Inadequacy of authoritybased defensive teaching and summative and productbased evaluation such as certification and observation measures in providing information about the actual teaching teachers do was an inspiration in this study to design an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competences This study aimed at designing an inventory for formative and processbased evaluation of teacher competencesMethods To this end teacher competences were theoretically defined and the indicators of competence in practice were derived and operationalized through Competency Framework for Teachers proposed by department of education and training in Australiaby a panel of five EFL English as a foreign language teaching experts through focused group discussion The resulting inventory wasitems on four teacher competences including critical clinical personal and technical competences from three perspectives of student departmental learning and growth measured onpoint likert scaleResults Testing the inventory withIranian EFL teachers indicated that there were high Cronbachs alpha reliability indices for the three main perspectives and their dimensions This implies that the inventory enjoyed appropriate internal consistency The results of exploratory factors analysis indicated that there was no construct irrelevant factor and all the indicators were loaded in the related teacher competence and perspective dimension Four separate structural equation models SEM were tested in order to probe the trait structure of the inventory The first three SEM models targeted the three perspectives individually while the last model explored the structure of the total data The results indicated that all items had significant contributions to their respective dimensionsConclusions The potential application of this inventory in teacher education programs and the factors that limit its applicability were discussedThe researcher seeks to address the needed changes to superintendent evaluation by suggesting an integrated formative evaluation process that balances both the need for accountability and ongoing professional growth and support Hallinger HeckMurphyDukeThe nuances of the superintendent and school board relationship present unique challenges that create additional obstacles and opportunities for establishing and maintaining a cyclical formative process for evaluation A brief overview of research that includes a rationale and overview of current challenges to the superintendent evaluation process are also discussed Practical tips for improving the evaluation process including adoption of a standardsbased framework utilizing stakeholder input providing board director professional learning and ongoing support are offeredThis paper describes a Networked Improvement Community comprised of a network ofstates focused on improving coherence and equity in state systems of science education Grounded in principles of improvement science adapted from healthcare we are developing and testing resources for formative assessment in science with the aim of developing systems where actors at every level of the education system are oriented toward a common vision for science and where there is a common commitment to equity The paper describes these strategies and implications of this work for districtlevel change effortsThere are many studies with a focus on examining and developing individuals Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge TPACK When examining these studies one can recognize that these studies are usually conducted with preservice teachers Nevertheless examining teachers preparation processes of classroom activities constitutes an important area for the improvement of instruction In this respect it is important to examine the preparatory process of computer assisted activities that mathematics teachers include in their lessons Hence in this study middle school mathematics teachers utilizations of the TPACK when designing classroom activities which they prepared by using the GeoGebra software were investigated Participants of the study consisted of three mathematics teachers who have been working in a middle school The data was collected by using an observation form which was developed by the authors and by conducting semistructured interviews with the participants The quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods were used in analyzing the collected data The findings showed that teachers had difficulty integrating their pedagogical knowledge into the technology throughout the activity design processes and had deficiencies in terms of the TPACKUsing Fuller and Bownsteacher concerns model as a framework we examined precursor strategies to Fuller and Bowns Stageconcern with student impact We examined preservice music teachers focus on teaching videos to determine a if participants focused on teacher or student b if prompts to notice students resulted in more comments about students c if focus on students maintained without instructions and d if results differed based on prior teaching experience with schoolaged students Preservice music teachers N viewed videos of music classesrehearsals specifying what you notice control n or what did the students do focused observation n As a posttest transfer participants viewed the pretest video again without instructions There were significant posttest differences indicating the extent to which instructions influenced participant focus and the effects of small amounts of teaching experience Specifically results showed that the inexperienced teachers with guided instructions responded more like experienced ones Implications for teacher preparation were discussedHow questions concerning democracy and emancipation thread through teacher education is currently under theorized and there is a paucity of crossnational studies examining the problem In this study we draw from a number of theoretical frameworks for their discursive positioning of democracy and emancipation in teacher education and what we are calling teacher educators democratic assignment The framework allowed us to identify key words which we then used for a limited content analysis of policy documents in two European countries Sweden and the Republic of Ireland in two separate timelinesandOur findings indicate that despite significant cultural and contextual differences between the two education systems key words linked to democracy and emancipation have significantly decreased in policy documentation in both countries in this timeline This prompts our hypothesis that a paradigm shift has occurred in the discursive positioning of teacher educators democratic assignment The findings suggest the need for a deeper discourse analysis of the four documents as the next phase in the research design The findings while tentative have implications well beyond two nation states for contemporary issues in teacher education and society that require collective consciousness and actionThis commentary highlights findings from two reviews of research on the preparation and continuing development of regular classroom teachers to teach English language learners Since both reviews use my central tasks of teacher learning framework the commentary also assesses the frameworks usefulness in highlighting areas where research exists and where it is lacking Looking across the reviews reveals that the area where most preservice studies cluster has the least number of inservice studies and vice versaThe article discusses the need for cohesion and support for writing teachers Topics include the need for a common curriculum for writing the use of checklists and rubrics and teacher collaboration in planning Also addressed are the role of literacy coaches in supporting writing instruction the development of professional expertise in teachers and the use of peer observations Professional learning workshops are notedThe purpose of this research is to examine the technology integration selfefficacy of prospective teachers in the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge determined in the context of International Society for Technology in Education Standards TPABISTE and to investigate whether the predictors of preparing preservice teachers for technology use predicted the TPACKISTE selfefficacy significantly and how well those values predicted the TPACKISTE selfefficacy Correlational and causalcomparative research designs of quantitative research methods were used in this research The sample consistsprospective teachers who study at undergraduate programs senior class level and pedagogical formation certificate programs atdifferent state universities in Turkey In this research a scale of which theoretical framework depends on TPACK and based on ISTEs standards is used for data collection According to the results of the research significant difference was seen in favor of male teacher candidates in terms of technological knowledge Also the prospective teachers who took computer courses based on a certificate had significantly higher technological knowledge and TPACKISTE selfefficacy scores than the others The results indicated no significant difference in all dimensions and general scores of TPACKISTE selfefficacy in point of the type of program that prospective teachers attended The predictors of preparing preservice teachers for technology use more significantly predicted technological knowledge and TPACKISTE selfefficacy dimensions than the other dimensionsArguably an essential element of a doctoral study is to establish and acknowledge a philosophical worldview As part of this researchers need to engage with and challenge their assumptions about the nature of being the nature of knowledge and what can be known Only then can methodological designs approaches to data analysis and relationships between researchers and participants be established and situated within a particular research paradigm Contextualised within a PhD study concerning teacher pedagogic practice this paper describes the process of abandoning a positivist worldview in favour of interpretivism The paper describes the process of developing an ethnographically inspired methodology combining practice theory Kemmis S and PGrootenboerSituating Praxis in

settings in order to explore understand and enhance teacher practiceThe purpose of the present study is to investigate preservice teachers and teachers selfefficacy beliefs in relation to some variables For this purpose the present study was designed as a descriptive study employing a general survey model The universe of the study consists of teachers working in a city of Anatolia in Turkey and fourthyear students from the departments of classroom teacher education science and technology teacher education Turkish language teaching and physical education teacher education of the education faculty at a university located in the same city inacademic year The sampling of the study includedteachers andpreservice teachers The findings of the study revealed that the preservice teachers selfefficacy beliefs do not vary significantly depending on their gender and whether they attend daytime or eveningtime classes yet their selfefficacy beliefs vary significantly depending on the department attended and reasons for professional preferences On the other hand on the teachers selfefficacy beliefs both gender and educational statues do not have a significant impact however professional seniority significantly affects their selfefficacy beliefs Moreover it was found that the participants of both groups have same level of selfefficacy perceptions of their professionThe authors report on three students argumentative knowledge construction in an asynchronous online graduate level geometry course designed for inservice secondary mathematics ISM teachers Using Weinberger and Fischers framework they analyzed the ISM teachers a geometry autobiography and b discussion board posts both comments and attached work including solutions to assigned problems and Geometric Sketchpad explorations throughout an week summer course The goal was to better understand the key similarities and differences in the nature of their interaction with each other and the course content that may have contributed to the differences in their knowledge construction Findings led researchers to reconceptualize a rubric toassist instructors in facilitating productive interaction among studentsprepare students to better utilize the discussion board with a critical eye andprovide specific guidelines for a more productive engagement among students using the framework as a guideThis study analyses teacherled clarification sequences in a university second language classroom setting from a conversationanalytic perspective In the literature there are many studies of clarification requests but the focus is on individual categories and quantification No previous study has examined clarification as reconceptualised in this study as a social action using Conversation Analysis methodology The study draws onhours of L classroom data from Newcastle University Corpus of Academic Spoken English database involving international students studying English as a second language The data is analysed using Conversation Analysis by specifically focusing on sequential organization and the repair mechanism The findings offer a qualitative and detailed account of clarification from an emic perspective The analysis suggests that teachers use three types of initiation in clarification and the selection of these types is shown to be strongly related to the extent of epistemic gaps The analysis also shows that teachers use two further resources when students fail to clarify These findings have implications for the organization of the repair mechanism in L classrooms and for training L teachersThe purpose of this study is to examine the metaphorical perceptions of international students in Turkey about multicultural education The study group is composed ofinternational students who are studying in different cities in Turkey Data were collected through facetoface interviews and electronically Descriptive analysis with a qualitative approach was used to analyze the data The findings of the study indicatedmetaphors produced by international students These metaphors were grouped under six conceptual categories in terms of their common characteristics For the definition of multicultural education the metaphors of rainbow n garden n and sea n were mostly used Additionally it has been identified that metaphoric perception of both general and some demographic variables such as gender and educational level are compatibleNational and statebased science and Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM initiatives expect educators to incorporate inquiry and designbased practices into their STEMcentric lesson planning While this is a new expectation and may be a challenge for all it is an even more prohibitive barrier for elementary teachers who often find STEM outside of their comfort zones Graduate coursework sensitive and attentive to elementary teachers needs is essential to prepare teachers for these instructional demands The Elementary STEM Instructional Leadership ESIL graduate program at McDaniel College a small liberal arts school in Maryland developed such a program in conjunction with Carroll County Public Schools and the National Institute of Aerospace The pilot cohort of elementary teachers for the ESIL program was the audience for this quantitative study Lesson plans developed by this cohort were assessed to gauge the teachers proficiencies in planning STEMcentric lessons A proportion of agreement consensus and test of hypothetical value provided results that suggest that the sample population demonstrated proficient planning abilities for targeted standards Findings from this research not only add to the fields knowledge of elements in the promotion of graduate coursework that leads to elementary inservice teachers proficiency in planning STEMcentric lessons but also have broader implications for teacher education at large The McDaniel College ESIL model could frame flexible K teacher education as it promotes analytical thinking and selfreflectionThe interactional architecture of L teaching and learning in preschool classrooms has been explored only to a limited extent despite the growing literature on L classroom discourse The existing literature on these settings mainly describes an interactional site with limited L interactional repertoires of the very young learners Accordingly preschool teachers seem to draw on repetitions and interactional routines to create opportunities for learner participation Against this background this study sets out to describe a preschool L classroom in which a preservice language teacher education project is implemented Based on a conversation analytic examination of the interactional unfolding of a repeat after me activity aimed at eliciting the students selfidentification the current study documents the interactional management of embodied resources The findings demonstrate that the teacher repeatedly deploys embodied directives and recurrently draws on repetition of the focal form Consequently the students show active engagement and participation in the activity The findings also provide implications for teaching English to very young learners and research on classroom interactional competence L classroom discourse embodiment and multimodalityMany physical educators today are teaching lifetime sports including outdoor activities such as cycling Even though cycling is a low impact exercise that aids stamina and fitness little is known about additional benefits in other areas including agility balance and explosive power The purpose of this study was to ascertain if there are physical benefits ie static balance explosive leg power agility to students participating in a single bicycling unit in physical education PE class Middle school students in the treatment school rode bicycles during their PE classes formonths Students in the control school did not have access to bicycles during PE classes Before the bicycle unit began students in both schools were measured on stork stand with eyes closed vertical jump and agility Students in the treatment school then participated in PE classes that included a bicycling unit whereas the control school students participated in PE classes that did not include bicycling Pretest scores were used as covariates and results showed that students in the treatment group scored higher than students in the control group at posttest on all three tests Although many schools have begun using lifetime activities in their PE classes the results suggest that these activities not only may be fun for students but also will help them experience fitness benefitsThe aim of this article is to elucidate how teacher researchers use a theoretical framework as mediated tool to create boundaries in communities of research practices CoRPs and how this effects student learning If and in what way knowledge developed in one practice can be used to inform the next is also examined Two teacher researchers implemented two CoRPs each one as internal participant and one as external participant In totalstudentsteachersteacher researchers andresearcher participated The qualitative analysis is framed by Wengers three boundary dimensions engagement imagination and alignment The results show that teachers actions in the second practice no matter if they were internal or external participants are characterized by a higher degree of security and knowledge and the lessons implemented are more effective regarding the students learning outcomes than in the first The results show that knowledge develops in an interaction order regardless of the internal or external community order The result from the first team informs the starting point for the second team and knowledge boundaries are transferred by the teacher researcher from one CoRP to the otherAn introduction is presented in which the editor discusess topics within the issue including education in public schools curricular reform in higher education and curriculum for English language learnersThis article presents findings from a multiyear qualitative study of K science teacher fellows involved in a grantfunded professional development program This research hones in on Yearwhere we examine the actions our fellows have taken in their districts as science teacher leaders and their sense of agency The following main themes emerged in the data how science teacher leaders see personalorganizational change as a process the importance of differentiated mentoring and support the fellows acceptance of roadblocks as part of the growth process and finally the value of reflection as a means to sustain leadership efforts beyond the fellowship We explore the implications for professional development programs in districts and in particular those that address the need to cultivate teacher leadershipDrawing on a teacher concerns framework alongside notions of critical consciousness this article examines the extent to which teacher candidates TCs concerns are related in any way to the critical scholarship they have engaged with throughout their teacher education coursework Utilizing teacher candidates written dilemmas of practice during student teaching as the primary data source the authors utilize consensual qualitative research for data analysis and share results within and across concern categories as related to notions of critical consciousness and dysconsciousness KingResults indicate that TCs posted self concerns lacked a critical inward journey that TCs were more likely to be critically conscious regarding their own positionality in schools yet overwhelmingly dysconscious when talking about students and families and that large percentages of dysconscious task concerns seem related to TCs lack of critically conscious posts about self The authors suggest the importance of more focused mentorship and assignments aimed at asking questions designed to promote critically conscious ways of being in classrooms and similarly suggest the importance of considering notions of critical consciousness in concernsbased studies moving forward The authors end with a note of caution on the movement toward core practices in teacher preparation and instead suggest the importance of programming that focuses on uncovering and eradicating dysconsciousness among TCs working with historically marginalized youthIn this article the authors describe the Japanese term bansho which refers to the intentional use of board space for facilitating student learning Bansho offers a structure for sequencing mathematics visually on the board By purposefully organizing the board space alongside the lesson teachers can provide students with a framework showing where the lesson starts the connections within the lesson and where the lesson is going Bansho is best suited for problems allowing multiple solutions or representations and it provides an intentional strategy for fostering mathematical communication in the classroom A bibliography is includedThe article offers

constructivism and Black feminism I sought to answer the following research questions a How does the teacher describe her teaching b How do her students describe her teaching and c How does her cultural background as an African American woman teacher influence her teaching Data collected for this study consisted of field notes teacher interviews student interviews and artifacts Analysis of the data yielded four dominant themes a Religious influence on teaching practice b an ethic of caring c identity as an othermother and d use of music as a vehicle for empowering studentsConsidering the general problem of integrating mathematical modelling into current educational systems this paper focuses on the italicecological dimensionitalic of this problemthe institutional constraints that hinder the development of mathematical modelling as a normalised teaching activityand the inevitable step of the professional development of teachers Within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic this step is approached using the italicstudy and research paths for teacher educationitalic SRPTE an inquirybased process combining practical and theoretical questioning of school mathematical activities We present a research study focusing on the design and analysis of an online and distancelearning course for inservice mathematics teachers based on the SRPTE methodology This course starts from the initial question of how to analyse adapt and integrate a learning process related to mathematical modelling and how to sustain its longterm development Our analysis is based on a case study consisting in four successive editions of a course for Latin American inservice mathematics teachers held at the Centre for Applied Research in Advanced Science and Technology in Mexico The starting point is a modelling activity about forecasting the number of Facebook users which includes functional modelling and regression The results show how the course represents a valuable instrument to help teachers progress in the critical issue of identifying institutional constraintsmost of them beyond the scope of action of teachers and students and not approached by previous researchhindering the integration of mathematical modelling in current secondary schoolsIn this study we argue that current conceptual frameworks used to understand how novices make sense of science ignore K teachers understanding to a detriment If teachers are supposed to translate the content context and culture of science to their students then it is important for researchers and policymakers to understand how this happens Communities of science practice COSP research identify the ways in which novices make sense of the practices of science within a space where they interact with observe and are affected by other members at varying levels of legitimacy In brief K students are rarely exposed to the COSP therefore teachers must translate these cultural pieces to their students while simultaneously teaching the content and practices of sciences We chose to focus on teachers who participated in a Research Experience for Teachers RET program The RET program served as a brief exposure to a COSP for these teachers The goal for our study was to develop a conceptual framework to study teachers experiences as spectator novices within a RET program Spectator novice was the term we used to define teachers roles as novices moving toward legitimacy within the COSP but with a different goalthat of observing the culture and translating it to their studentsfrom science undergraduate and graduate students who are attempting to become full legitimate participants within the community Through interviews with teachers we developed a conceptual framework that can guide future research on the unique experiences of teachers as spectator novices within the COSP PsycINFO Database Record cAPA all rights reservedRabies is an important neglected disease which kills aroundpeople a year Over a third of these deaths are in children less thanyears of age Almost all human rabies deaths in Africa and Asia are due to bites from infected dogs Despite the high efficacy of current rabies vaccines awareness about rabies preventive healthcare is often low in endemic areas It is therefore common for educational initiatives to be conducted in conjunction with other rabies control activities such as mass dog vaccination however there are few examples where the efficacy of education activities has been assessed Here primary school children in Zomba Malawi were given a lesson on rabies biology and preventive healthcare Subsequently a mass dog vaccination programme was delivered in the same region Knowledge and attitudes towards rabies were assessed by a questionnaire before the lesson immediately after the lesson andweeks later to assess the impact the lesson had on school childrens knowledge and attitudes This assessment was also undertaken in children who were exposed to the mass dog vaccination programme but did not receive the lesson Knowledge of rabies and how to be safe around dogs increased following the lesson both p and knowledge remained higher than baselineweeks after the lesson both p Knowledge of rabies and how to be safe around dogs was greater amongst school children who had received the lesson compared to school children who had not received the lesson but had been exposed to a rabies vaccination campaign in their community both p indicating that the lesson itself was critical in improving knowledge In summary we have shown that a short focused classroombased lesson on rabies can improve short and mediumterm rabies knowledge and attitudes of Malawian schoolchildrenThe article presents questions and answers related to the works of Great Britains House of Commons on topics including apprenticeships first aid curriculum in schools and the number of schools eligible for free mealsEpidemiology instruction has expanded at the undergraduate level in part because it increases student critical thinking and scientific literacy promotes students perception of public health as both practical and relevant and empowers students as independent lifelong learners Why then are more high schools not adopting epidemiology as a course requirement for students Although prior iterations of high school epidemiology courses are noteworthy for incorporating active and participatory learning embedding them into existing and continually shifting curricula is challenging and timeconsuming especially for teachers not trained in the field It also may be argued that currently available epidemiology teaching resources emphasize content rather than thinking skills and therefore do not optimally promote students personal engagement with and indepth understanding of the mission and goals of public health I propose a new framework for high school epidemiology that draws from progressive education ideology including three critical elements empowerment authenticity and transfer I provide multiple examples to show how this framework has been used across a wide array of settings to hone epidemiology thinking skills in high school studentsProfessional rank is an important indicator of the professional capacity of compulsory education teachers A rational professional rank evaluation system plays an important role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of teachers improving the overall quality of teachers and promoting the development of education Based on stratified random sample data from compulsory education teachers incounties and cities inChinese provinces this study analyzes the multiple impacts of urban and rural compulsory education teacher professional rank on teacher salaries development opportunities and work duties The authors found the following a Urbanrural differences exist in the opportunity to access compulsory education teacher professional rank rural school teachers are disadvantaged in accessing professional rank especially senior rank b Significant salary differences exist among teachers of different ranks as well as significant urbanrural differences in the total monthly incomes and monthly salary among teachers of the same rank c Teachers of different ranks have different opportunities to participate in training and undertake school duties Within the same rank rural teachers have fewer opportunities to participate in highlevel training and have a higher proportion of school duties d Significant differences exist among teachers of different ranks in terms of average classroom hours per week and important duties undertaken There is a significant urbanrural difference in average weekly classroom hours and important duties among teachers of the same rank weekly classroom hours are higher for rural teachers while they have more opportunities to undertake important dutiesThe end of the th and early th centuries is characterized by justification of reforming pedagogical trends in Western Europe and accumulation of relevant ideas required to create a new type of school educate independent and initiative individuals and improve teacher training Based on comparative pedagogical analysis of the mentioned period the content of individualistic free creativity of students and teachers experimental studying general patterns and individual characteristics of students physical and spiritual development social establishing relationships between education and community Herbartinian educational teaching development of various interests monistic methodological principle of continuity in cognition unity and invariance of world laws pedagogical trends have been analyzed It has been found that the conceptual foundation for foreign pedagogical trends was the study of personality traits of the student as the object of pedagogical influence and their unifying basis was a welldeveloped personality of the student as well as their cognitive activity It has been revealed that young teachers are primarily responsible for developing active independent creative personalities able to change the world around It has been determined that an important factor in developing their pedagogical mastery is the ability to analyze and use innovative ideas of representatives of the latest pedagogical trends to master new educational technologies methods and of course special skills in developing the childs personality It has been proved that young teachers career success is associated with development of their personal qualities namely friendliness humanity great love and care for childrenConstant ICT development brings new channels of communication and new forms of media content It creates new habits of information consumption This is evident particularly among children and students Their perception and reception influenced by quality and quantity change is evolving There is a significant change in the process of information selection and its absorption The time of learning is not limited to school activity homeworking is constant along with other life activities It generates new challenges for educational systemmainly for teachers The article is an attempt to describe this phenomenon and formulate some directions for teachersmethod suggestions as well as a tool selection The content of the article is based on the outcomes of the authors research Indications addressed to teachers whose daily work is most affected by the new situation with ICT have been formulated In the process of study the following pragmatic conclusions have been made children and adolescents are accustomed to receiving short interactive content the amount of information that reaches the youth is vast and requires an ability to assess and choose in order to draw the recipients attention the content should be communicated in an interactive form that is highly attractive for the recipient children and adolescents far more often use content that is available online than that from other sources of information work with more lengthy texts and an indepth content analysis is necessary for the proper development of both children and adolescents despite being unpopular among these groups children and adolescents have a valuable ability to shift focus from one subject on another though their capacity to multitask is only apparent children and adolescents expect their actions to give rapid results children and adolescents have a competence potential and a technical potential to use IT tools that facilitate access to information and learning due to the vast number and the diversity of available activities a stronger motivation to learn in required An inventory of recommendations addressed to teachers has been also presented in the paper It has been defined that their delivery will facilitate the implementation of teaching tasks hence diminishing the concerns that arise in this regardBu alma

students The impact of these outreach efforts can be influenced by many things but the instructional delivery method can affect how students are exposed to new topics or how confident teachers feel about incorporating new concepts into the classroom A study was conducted with a series of university entomology outreach programs using insects as a vehicle for teaching environmental education These programs were used to assess differences between three of the most common universitybased outreach delivery methods Scientist in the Classroom Teacher Training Workshops and Online Curriculum for their effect on student interest and teacher selfefficacy Surveys administered tofifth grade classrooms found that the delivery method might not be as important as simply getting insects into activities This study found that the lessons had a significant impact on student interest in environmental and entomological topics regardless of treatment All students found the lessons to be more interesting valuable and important over the course of the year Treatment also did not influence teacher selfefficacy as it remained high for all teachersHybrid teacher leadership HTLthat is teachers

accountability policies including the Common Core State Standards and teacher evaluation and how this process relates to school priorities and classroom practiceDesignmethodologyapproach This study uses a comparative case study approach to understand how principals and teachers in three highpoverty urban schools respond to policyFindings Although principals and teachers viewed academic standards and the teacher evaluation framework as complementary two of the three schools focused on meeting the expectations of the teacher evaluation framework at the expense of attention to academic standards Without attention to the connections among policies and school priorities the introduction of new policies may detract from rather than reinforce attention to academic standardsResearch limitationsimplications Principals who are stronger instructional leaders may be better able to craft coherence among multiple standardsbased policies and school priorities for instruction and student learning Although their experiences are not generalizable findings suggest that attending to standards for student and teacher performance without connecting to the implications for content and students learning may lead to superficial integration of accountability policies with school prioritiesPractical implications Findings provide further evidence that principals play an essential role in responding to policy and suggest that districts and external support providers can assist their efforts by creating opportunities for professional learning about the connections among multiple policies and their implications for practiceOriginalityvalue This paper extends Honig and Hatchs conceptualization of crafting coherence to the work of teachers and the implications for classroom practiceMultilingualism is an important element in the life of modern people and a relevant topic of professional scientific and political discussion This paper will shed light on theoretical aspects of multilingualism past and present concepts of multilingualism the advocacy for and the promotion of multilingualism in the EU as well as multilingualism in educational discourse and teachers professional development The next section focuses on a project that puts multilingualism into practice in a creative manner and can thus be seen as a role model in this field of work The paper pays special attention to the teachers who work within the framework of multilingualism and to their new roles distinctly different from the traditional teacher role The concept of multilingualism as established and realized by the project covers multilingualism at the border of three countries three languages and three educational systems and could be used as a model for other similar practicesThe last decade has witnessed a steady increase in the number of preschool programs operating in Australia where children access a natural outdoor space in the bush at the beach or in local parkland for an extended period of time each week Over a hundred such programs are now estimated to be operating in Victoria alone In this paper Victorian educators from the Early Childhood Outdoor Learning Network respond to concerns regarding the direction of Forest Schools and the commodification of Forest School practices in the UK as raised by Leather Journal of Outdoor and Environmental Educationand the suggestion that a similar model of Forest Schools has spread to Australia It is argued that the proliferation of nature kindergarten programs in Victoria has followed a more organic trajectory that is less about emulating a set of imported practices and more about responding to local conditions and influences Teaching practice in these programs has been described as naked pedagogy emphasizing the role of childled play without tools toys and art supplies The authors argue that despite a considerable and growing body of both popular and academic literature on the benefits of nature and play few studies have explored this type of nature kindergarten program in the context of early childhood education in AustraliaWhile many states have adopted new requirements for teacher evaluations in pursuit of Race to the Top funding DarlingHammondthis qualitative case study of one Rocky Mountain school district that has been working on developing a system of supervision and evaluation to support teacher effectiveness for over a decade examines how teachers believe the supervision and evaluation practice impacts their daily classroom instructional practices Five themes emerged from the interview data ofteachers across the district and in diverse teaching positions Feedback quality of relationships the evaluation rubric modeling personal integrity and selfreflection were identified as mechanisms that enabled teachers to benefit from the existing system These themes revealed the complexity of the system in which multiple mechanisms must work in coordination in order for teachers to realize the benefits in their daily instructional practiceThe article discusses the journey of the Robla School District in California in

revisits a developmental model of professorsasteachers that provides a useful framework for considering emotion in teaching and learningResearch has suggested that independent study students in online courses may benefit from engaging with a proximate community of engagement PCE and that students perceive that such engagement will help them succeed Independent Study students were surveyed at the completion of their course to assess the level at which they actually interacted with a PCE Survey findings were confirmed with followup interviews with students and their parents to triangulate survey data Findings revealed that students in the study interacted with a PCE when completing the course The percentage of students actually engaged with a PCE was lower than the percentages of students from a previous study who perceived that such engagement would be helpful The research suggests that students made aware of the benefits of a PCE at the beginning of the course and who receive coaching to curate that community as an assignment in the course will be more likely to receive the learning benefits of community engagement Future research to confirm the value of engaging with a proximate community identifying most helpful and effective interactions and helping students curate such a community are proposedThe purpose of this case study was to investigate how an

education faces intensifying pressure to prove its effectiveness This has prompted renewed interest in program redesign In this article we argue that enacting meaningful redesign requires universitybased teacher educators to learn new ways of thinking and acting not only with teacher candidates but also with their university and K colleagues Drawing on Engestrms expansive learning theory and our own efforts to redesign our teacher education program along a practicebased teacher education model we delineate a conceptual framework and illustrate how it supports the organizational learning necessary to enact change in universitybased teacher education The expansive learning redesign framework specifies conceptual tools and social practices to guide enact and sustain universitybased teacher education redesign It acknowledges the multiorganizational nature of universitybased teacher education and provides tools for engaging K educators in the redesign of teacher educationThe article offers tips for enhancing literacy instruction of students with intellectual disability Topics discussed include importance of providing explicit systematic reading instruction

been increasing day by day however limited number of studies has provided both quantitative and qualitative findings based on teachers learning by design experiences This study aimed to reveal the changes in preservice teachers TPACK competencies in the educational website design process and their experiences in the design process within the scope of a course based on TPACK framework and the learning by design approach Designed as an embedded mixed design research the study was conducted withpreservice teachers The data were collected through the TPACKdeep scale a survey and emails sent to the instructors The research concluded that the learning by design approach brings preservice teachers TPACK competencies in highly effective significant contributions Moreover it was revealed that the design process expands preservice teachers schemas regarding the properties which digital instructional materials should possess The research also enlightened the motivating factors such as receiving support and the challenging factors such not being able to use software for the preservice teachers in the design process Finally the findings were interpreted within the framework of TPACK and the learning by design approach and recommendations were made for future practices and studiesThe article discusses literacy teaching and learning that enables readers understand what Literacy

to middle school science students using four different solar ovens out in the sunlight for an hour prior to the science lesson It highlights characteristics of different solar ovens to optimize heat transfer through conduction convection and radiationPolicy enactment is a dynamic process which invites agents to uniquely create and recreate policy as an ongoing process Few policies arrive in school fully formed and the process of policy enactment involves teachers navigating policy frameworks in a way that provides success for each individual pupil This research examines the complexities involved in teacher enactment of new policy in schools with the added caveat of investigating the impact that highstakes exams place on teachers to act as agents of change The primary objective was to ascertain whether inhibitors and facilitators identified in literature were recurring during the period of change in physical education PE The secondary objective was to investigate how PE teachers enact curriculum change utilising a flexible curriculum framework to achieve success at examination level The research reflects a journey from the broad realms of curriculum studies towards a more indepth analysis of the realist theory of analytical dualism Semistructured individual interviews were conducted with five full time PE teachers working within one secondary school in Scotland The results indicated that revolutionary change was somewhat stagnated by potent inhibitors such as a lack of collaboration with policymakers and vague course documentation These were compounded by an inherent desire for pupils to succeed that induced feelings of wariness and indecision amongst teachers The flexible curriculum and guidance offered by policymakers was insufficient for teachers to confidently pose as curriculum decisionmakers resulting in a call for a more explicitly structured course It became clear that teachers acting as agents of change who help devise and develop policy require support collaboration and direction to empower and buttress their decisionmaking particularly when faced with the highstakes nature of the examination climateThis study uses boundary crossing in activity theory as one normative framework for opening a deliberative inquiry in new discursive spaces to elicitgender awarenessin teachers practices We illustrate this framework by drawing from data in one European teacher education project Seven case studies were conducted and data were analysed from a convenience sample of teacher educators who alongside the authors acted as national coordinators for the project Data sources included questionnaires of initial ratings case study reports transcripts of team meetings and interviews A cluster analysis of ratings was guided in a stepwise manner and yielded two distinct cluster groups where one group of case studies had high ratings of genderspecific settings This finding was then used in a qualitative interpretation of data sources for deeper contextual understandings of teacher educators perspectives Genderspecific settings had a reported context of aspects in an activity system which three case studies grasped as schoolbased planning pedagogical innovation and mentoring supports The framework for analysis of higher order gender aspects showed success in distinguishing case studies with isolated views of gender Findings also showed limitations in the partially restricted framing of gender as an activity system at the outset of the project and indicated in some instances reluctant teacher educators The study underscores the explanatory power of the framework adopted and opens up hypotheses for further research and considerationThis study investigates the characteristics of an L expert teacher educator
